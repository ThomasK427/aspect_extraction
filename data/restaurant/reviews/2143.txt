food also sucks
its oily expensive chinese food which i can microwave at home for a fraction of the price!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!
A fantasic spot for a quick, refreshing lunch
Service was quaint and cuisine was authentically fresh
All in all, a pleasurable dining experience
When I read girl in the city's review, I thought it was a review I had already written!   Same story: always curious to try, finally dragged boyfriend, and we both HATED the food
Both of our dishes (I think we had curries) were absolutely tasteless
No amount of salt and pepper could fix
Let your curiousity run wild, but don't try!
The location is ideal, right by the (6) train by a major movie theater on 2nd Avenue, by so many nice bars on 3rd Avenue
The locale is small but comfortable
It seems to be a family run business and the service is prompt, professional and polite
Come here for a good tasting well prepared meal
I shared a plate of Momo (tibetan dumplings) with my wife
We chased the mild taste of the Momo with the spiciest dish on the menu: Cauliflower, potatoes, peas in a lettuce bowl marinated in a red curry - yogurt sauce
It was delicious and appropriately served with a Kirin Ichiban Beer
For 3 beers, 1 plate of momo + the 2 entrees (which include a tibetan style pita bread) I paid $43
00
Do not forget they have a party room downstairs
Since I live quite close to this restaurant, I would often take a gander at the menu and remind myself that I should try it sometime soon
One night when I was feeling adventurous, I dragged my boyfriend there, and was utterly disappointed
After asking the waiter several questions about a potential entree, I ordered a dish that in no way matched its description in the menu or what the waiter had told me
It was the most disgusting thing I ever laid eyes on - completely inedible and very unappetizing
And, to make matters worse, they refused to bring me something else
Definite lack of class
The supposed manager said that next time, I should order a different chicken dish which he thought would be more to my liking
Well, buddy - there isn't going to be a next time
My advice: avoid this place or order very carefully!
I had a surprise party for my Fiance in May at El Parador it was also the place where I took her on our first date three years ago and I must say everything was excellent!!!
The Owners Alex Manny took great care in making sure everything was just right
When we needed anything whether it was music or more food it was done quickly and efficently I strongly recommend El Parador whether you just want to go out and have a great meal or throw an awesome party!!!
The waiters and staff are rude as well as the owner
I've been there and had decent food but most of the time the food is just bad
Do yourself a favor and patronize elsewhere
Positive reviews are probably that of owner
It is our neighborhood stand-by
we never have a bad time (we've been there at least 25 times)
The decor isn't terrific, but you won't find a better vibe at any of the other higher end mexican restaurants
The drinks are excellent, especially the tamarind margaritas and the mojitos
The food is creative, interesting and always very well prepared
Service is solid and cheerful
Come with a small group of good friends and be ready to have that warm, fuzzy, totally content feeling
This is truly that local gem that all true New Yorker's seek out
I have been going to this establishment since I was a little boy (over 20 years) when Don Carlos was the maitre'd (an incredibly kind, funny guy)
to this day I return with my wife, friends and family for the following reasons: 1)I have NEVER had a bad meal, in fact the food is OUTSTANDING--Nachos like none you've ever had, the BEST salsa and chips around, great guacamole, FANTASTIC frozen margaritas, every traditional Mexican dish is delicious as are the ribs 2)the atmosphere is very romantic 3)last and certainly not least, carrying in the tradition of Carlos, the current owner alex is one of the nicest people in the biz
Just had my wife's 30th birthday party here and it was amazing
The owner, Manny, and his son, Alex were extremely accomodating as was the entire staff
The food was excellent and the ambiance was perfect
The subterranean lounge was a perfect size for an intimate party of 30-40 guests and the decor was a tasteful latin vibe
I never type up reviews or recommendations of places(primarily because of my lazy nature), but I felt that this place was more than deserving of the task
my boyfriend and i went back to el parador for our 2nd anniversary dinner, after we'd moved out of murry hill
this place is just wonderful
when we walked in the manager greeted us so warmly i couldn't tell if he remembered us from previous times or if he was just being an excellent host
the food and service were great
if you're looking for a nice, romantic place to go for some great food el parador should definitely be on your list
I just visited this restaurant and found it to be very cordial, quiet atmosphere the food was great
Their margaritas are on the money
As an entree, I had the chicken enchilada, which was very filling
I would recommend this place to anyone who made an inquiry for great Mexican food
Ok
the person who typed their review in all caps does not know what they are talking about
El Parador
Fantastic Margaritias Excellent Service
The owners
Alex and Anthony
none better in NYC The shrimp Quesadilla
out of this world
A little off the beaten path
but WAY worth it
I can't believe no one added El Parador to the list of Best Margaritas in town
This gourmet delight of a Mexican restaurant offers wonderful margaritas, straight-up or frozen
I prefer straight-up myself
Always a pleasure to dine here
Also, they serve a delicious sangria, full of fruit flavor and a nice punch
One of the best dishes is their chicken chilaqilles (sp?)
Savory and downright delicious
Service is always dependable and friendly
The staff are always there with a smile
I go to El Parador every other week, so I guess you could say I'm a regular
I'm a great fan of this seemingly out-of-the-way spot
I'll go the extra block or two to be at home with Alex and Anthony, who do a great job hosting and cooking
Again, the best margaritas are at El Parador
I recommend this highly
I had walked by el parador many times, and it never really struck me as a place I had to go to
Let me tell you, this place is AMAZING! I went with a group of people and we all had something different, so I tried many dishes
For appetizers, we had the peanut butter stuffed jalepenos, which were DELICIOUS
U must try those
THe guacomole is perfect and made everything even better
THe chicken liver appetizer was great and the cerviche was wonderful
For dinner, I had the famous el parador chicken which was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten
The pork chops were also great
One aspect I was not too enthused about was the service
However, TRY THIS PLACE
I guarantee you will love it
It is the best mexican restaurant i have ever been to
This guy is one of the singular restaurant talents in New York City
It's fitting he should run the dining room made famous by Don Carlos, perhaps NYC's best Maitre d' ever
Not easy shoes to fill, but Alejandro brings energy and excitement to old school and El Parador has survived the coming and going and coming back of Mexican food
The shrimp quesadillas call to me from across town
I love this place! The mood and food are always perfect, the staff are overly friendly and will do anything to make your meal more pleasant

Shortly after we suggested this place to our friends and they too returned raving about both the food and the service---see for yourself--you wont be disappointed!
I came across this cute restaurant while walking down Bleeker
I found the service to be friendly and very knowledgeable with the menu
I have never been offered medium size plates before, but I took the waitresses recommendation and it worked out well
The food was amazing
Their lobster bisque had chunks of lobster in it which was a very nice surprise
Everything was great, but my favorite was the chocolate mousse
The menu said to allow 12 minutes for prep time
It was worth every minute
When I put my spoon through the cake like outer shell, this oozing chocolate goodness came out
It was absolutely delicious
I hope to go there again soon
New York City has a new destination restaurant--a West Village hidden gem, called CITRON restaurant
From decor thru food and wine, as well as EXCEPTIONAL, attentive and informative service, this sophisticated yet causal eatery is THE PLACE to have lunch, brunch, and ESPECIALLY dinner
The signature medium size plates are beautifully complimented by red/white wines by the glass, bottled beers, and amazing sakes
My favorite part, however, is the dessert menu--each and every one, from the decadent Chocolate MOUSSE to the unorthodox signature FRENCH TOAST with BLUE CHEESE, CHILLIES, and DATES is so exquisite and full of passion, you almost feel like crying
BRAVO to the creative Chef and his outstanding supporting team!
Wandering through the Village on Friday night we hit upon this hidden gem in the midst of lots of family-style Italian restaurants
The service was attentive albeit at times a little snappy but overall quite good
We had great wine for less than $30 a bottle and the food was very good
Their medium sized portions are pretty decent sized to Europeans like me and we didn't feel the need to follow through with the recommended 3 dishes per person
Highlights: the mushroom efaulliette and the french toast with blue cheese as dessert
Great experience
This place is wonderful! We went with clients the Saturday of the blizzard, with our fingers crossed
Couldn't have been more lucky
Fabulous server, who explained every dish - and told us which ones NOT to order , superb wine, paced perfectly
Just a pleasure in every way
My friends and I had a great time at Citron
The food is amazing - I loved everything I've had so far, including the desserts
The decor is beautiful and the service is really good
They have a large wine selection, too, at reasonable prices
I really reccommend it - check out this place!
The Scene Italian food is taken seriously in Carroll Gardens, and this restaurant--helmed by two Franks, Falcinelli and Castronovo--meets neighborhood standards
The warm interior, with exposed-brick walls, wooden tables, a pressed-tin ceiling and soft lighting, adds a touch of romance
The informal, knowledgeable staff guides patrons through the moderately priced, Italian-heavy wine list
The Food While the fine selection of meats and cheeses merit a sample, it's the short list of rotating specials that keeps neighborhood regulars coming back
Start with a delicate mound of watercress, surrounded by light fig puree, before moving on to heartier fare like the sweet-spicy combination of homemade cavatelli and hot sausage, which will have you sopping the last bits of sage butter off the plate
The slow-cooked braciola, pork swimming in a tangy marinara, is another surefire bet
For dessert, the tiramisu is a smooth, decadent treat
I've been to Frankie's twice, and the first time it was very good
The house wine was more than acceptable, the gnocchi perfectly cooked and flavorful and the dessert, totally scrumptious
I bragged to all my friends about Frankie's (which is only up the street from my apartment) and finally convinced some Manhattanites to come out to Brooklyn for it
Well, you can imagine my embarrassment when the wait staff was no where to be found, the gnocchi completely bland and the other dishes average
I may go there again with a friend in the neighborhood, but after that experience, I certainly won't brag about it again!!
I have been here several times, and each experience has been good
The food is great, and the menu is arranged so you can order multiple things and share
My favorite thing is the roasted vegetable salad
The service varies, but the I have found the employees to be consistently nice, never rude, and sometimes a little spacey
I would recommend going at off-times (before 7 perhaps) to avoid the crowds as it gets packed and there isn't much room by the bar
I am a regular at Frankies, I love this place
This is where you go to get real Italian food
Their gnocchi and cavatelli are worth the trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn
The cheesecake is out of this world
I have always found the staff to be knowledgable about the food and wine selection as well as highly accomodating
What a disappointment!! We heard such great things about this place, but the service was atrocious and the food was merely mediocre
The wait-staff were completely clueless
Not worth the price or the hassle getting a table
There are much better options in Brooklyn
STAY AWAY!!!!!!
Just had a wonderful evening sharing very reasonably priced carafes of the house red at frankies
The outside area was closed for service but the staff let us sit outside on the charming gravel-filled backyard and enjoy our wine in the relaxed setting
Beautiful space in the middle of park slope
A beautiful space inside and out
Meatballs !!! Wine choices!!! The friendly people, just like family
Will go back
again and again
especially in the summer for the outside space
The staff is rude beyond anything I've ever seen
The front of the restaurant is crowded and uncomfortable but there's an outdoor area that is the biggest waste of space I've ever seen--and not even attractive
The food was mediocre at best
But even if it had been the best food I'd ever tasted, I would never go back there thanks to the horrible service
SOFO! This place is what the neighborhood is all about
Toni loves the cavatelli
She took the idea home and makes it several times a month
Being a longtime City girl with a Midwestern upbringing, I both expect great service and am repelled by attitude
Frankie's, which I now take everyone who enters Brooklyn to, is A DELIGHT in every way
It has waits during prime times, sure
But there's a great bar and an excellent wine list
Some reviewers were sitting there waiting angrily for their waiters to be psychic
Um
ASK
It's like your own Italian family--you need something, SAY something
and they will take care of you
This is BROOKLYN, baby!
I am a completely loyal customer
I've been going there since before they started serving food, and the Franks have done everything right
The food is excellent, service is excellent, prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is excellent
And they make you feel like part of the family
Both brunch and dinner are fantastic
Best french toast I have ever had
And the best Bloody Mary I've had in NYC
My only complaint is that as it's gotten more popular, it's gotten harder to get a table
This is of course not theor fault; more a testament to how good it is, and they deserve it
Frankies is one of absolute favorite restaurants in NYC
after what felt like a never eding search for a restaurant i was neevr going to find i got lucky, a little help from mapquest was all it took
the place is cramped and the wait might not be what one would prefer
reservations are not accepted and you can only pay cash
despite all of this the food is awesome and so s the service
one stop here and you will be back for seconds
the gnocchi was great and so was my arugala and buffalo mozzarela cheese salad

We look forward to returning soon as husband and wife and maybe even beforehand
Have been back to PM many times, both in the main room and the private wine cellar for special occasions
The food is always wonderful, inventive, different (wild boar anyone?) and delicious
The service never fails, from the moment you step in, until your completely sated departure
The space is beautiful, romantic, welcoming
I've turned on countless friends to PM and all have had the same experiences
Toques off to John Greco, Herb Westphalen staff
We are clowns in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and after a nap on Thanksgiving Day, we always have our holiday dinner at Phillip Marie's
This is one restaurant where the holiday meals are as good as other days
You even get a turkey dinner to take home regardless of what you order! The presentation, food, and friendly yet professional service are always excellent and the restaurant charming
Delightful in the warm weather when you can eat outside and do some great people watching while you enjoy delicious meals
A great find in a great neighborhood
My husband brought me to Phillip Marie on our first date
Three years later we got engaged in the romantic and charming wine room where the service is outstanding and the food absolutely delicious
We even had our engagment dinner here where our entire family raved about the unique dinner choices, excellent wine, and family atmosphere
Our favorites are the Wild Boar and Fried Green tomatos!  The Martino's
We found PM when we purchased a Wine Cellar Dinner for Two that John had donated to a Cancer Care Auction
After having a couple of great lunches and a fabulous Australian wine tasting dinner, we finally tried the private dinner in the wine cellar - WOW! Personal server, excellent food and service with matching wines
We just gave a certificate for the same kind of evening to our newly engaged daughter
We cannot wait to do it again; dozens of friends we have sent there have only raved
Go Philip Marie and your great manager-Herb
Thanks for enjoyable times
Your faithful Patrons - David and Sharon
We visit NYC at least twice a year and always try to have dinner at PM at least once during our visit
The service is always professional yet friendly which creates a comfortable, relaxing dining experience
I find the food to be inventive and at the same time very satisfying with an emphasis on fresh ingredients
All in all, an experience worth repeating even though we only visit a few times a year
Dining at Philip Marie is an experience that everyone deserves
The moment you walk in, you're embraced with an at home feeling
John, Herb and the staff really know how to make each experience unique
The food is DIVINE!!! The food coupled with the service


you can't go wrong


hey, and the price is right!!!! Cudos to John and his staff!
We dine out here frequently
We love the attentive, friendly wait staff and interesting menu
The food is delicious and the atmosphere comforting
This place is a fantastic little gem for all to enjoy
The hosts/owners are very friendly and they instill that quality in their servers
The food is a unique mix of cajun, american, and even some french flavors
Try the singing scallops if you are lucky enough to be there on a night where they aren't sold out or out of season
There is a private dining room in the basement, where the old colonial kitchen used to be, really a very comfortable spot
The best tables are at or near the front windows, but the whole place has comfortable quality to it
I have eaten there quite a few times and have never been disappointed
Bon appetit!
We stopped here on the way to another restaurant because they had 2 for 1 drinks and thought we'd try it out
The bartender could not have been nicer (or cuter) and gave us 2 coupons for a free bottle of wine for next time
After trying to get into every Mexican place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo we decided to use our coupon at Philip Marie and couldn't have been happier
We sat outside on a beautiful night, the staff was so friendly, the food was great, and the wine was wonderful
I got the dancing shrimp and the next time I think I'll get them again and get the singing scallops to accompany them
: ) Can't wait to try the brunch
Philip Marie is always great
You can always count on excellent service, excellent food, a nice variety of food, a wonderful jazz brunch, a comfortable open-airy atmosphere, really nice people and staff, and just an overalll fresh invigorating experience
The tasting room downstairs looks like a great place for an event
The food is fantastic
Try the white chocolate french toast or the farmers omlette
This place has it all
Great food, great wine, romantic ambience, and good value for a village restaurant
The service is good and the atmosphere is great
Good place to sit on their patio for dinner in the summer
My boyfriend come here a lot in the summer when we can sit outside
For lunch we often split the BLT (the best BLT I have ever had) and a fruit plate
For dinner we love the muscles, the scallops and the wild boar
The service is hit-or-miss and sometimes just bizarre, but the food is always excellent
I am pleased to have this restaurant in our neighborhood
This was my second visit and I could not get back here fast enough!! It is a NY MUST while the neighbor has sky rocketed in prices attitude and the over abundance of 'so so' food, Philip Marie has shined with its excellence if Food Service and Ambiance unlike anything else in the Village
The old world style and professionalism makes this a definate NY GEM!
We've lived in New York for 10 years and haven't had a brunch experience as bad as this one
The coffee came cold, our waitress was in her sweats (eating a pear no less!), the staff spent most of the time eating breakfast at a separate table and neglecting customers, and the food was just god awful
Anything interesting on the menu? Sorry, they were out of it
Never again
As a native new yorker I 1) know a deal when I see one and 2) know when food is as it should be
This restaurant blows me away everytime I go there
I live in the neighborhood, go at least once a week, and am never disappointed
From the courteous staff to the amazing food, I am never disappointed
If you haven't been here you are really missing out
They also have two awesome private dining rooms they I am dying to try
Enjoy!!
i had never been to this restaurant before, and my decision was based solely on the reviews
i was kinda nervous, cause i was meeting 5 other people there
but they did live up to their fame
it was a really fun experiance
the unlimited mimosa bruch was great ! they kept filling up our glasses
didnt ever see the bottom of my glass ! food was good with generous portions
i left full and happy
would definately recommend this place for a casual lunch, a romantic dinner, a family event, mother's day
anything ! just go
you'll like it !
A great comfort food type menu served much more elegantly
Delicious menu, excellent presentation, and great service
A cozy bar area to meet someone for a casual drink to boot!
My husband and I dine hear at least twice a month
The food is exceptional, the atmosphere lovely, and the service very attentive
The decor is a little cheesy (gotta get rid of the murals, tree branches, and tapestry drapes), but the place feels warm and inviting
Be sure to check out the private dining areas downstairs - lovely table for two in the wine vault and the private party room toward the front of the property
Just delightful! (I'd like to recommend the squid ink lobster-filled ravioli in tomato cream sause - my favorite!!)
This place was amazing! After a terrible appetizer/drinks experience a few blocks away, we stumbled upon this oasis of welcoming staff, great service, awesome martinis and to-die-for desserts

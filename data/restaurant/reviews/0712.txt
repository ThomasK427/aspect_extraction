Tequila guys did a nice job but could have done with a microphone
Stumbled onto Agave on a craving for an outdoor spot with guac and beer
and found a gem! Agave is very well decorated, hip but not hipper than thou, classy but casual, great food, well-priced Stellas are a huge bonus! Nice outdoor seating
Waitress was a little spacey, but forgiven as we had an unexpectedly great time! I have recommended it to many friends and none have been disappointed to date
I visited Agave for the first time last Friday after a stressful day at work and home
The ambiance was lovely and the staff very corteous
The Tuna appetizer was wonderful and the carne asada tacos, to die for!!! The passion drink was soothing
Definitely a lady drink
I will return soon
What a great restaurant I came across this weekend
Done in Southwestern decor it looks great
First we walked in and were greeted by the friendliest guy, who we found out was their manager
We couldn't decide if we wanted to sit outside in the cafe or inside
We sat inside and had the greatest Blue Frozen Margaritas
Followed by really great food
The crowd was also fun so the whole experience was fantastic
Go as soon as you can
First, the good news
Absolutely great food
Now,the rest
Snotty, obnoxious manager made us wait even though tables were available
The waiter disappeared after the main course
We asked the manager for help, he blew us off
Drinks were priced at 9, showed up as ten
Why Oh, you ordered them straight up
That's extra alcohol
I say it's extra chutzpah
Maybe success has gone to their heads
I recently broke my leg and was looking for someplace in the neighborhood
Lucky, for me I stumbled into Agave
I had the avocado salad and Tuna as my entree
The food was fab!!!!
The drinks were fun and the service right on mark
I'm happy I have a place to stumble back into
Went there last night for a birthday celebration and was pleasantly surprised
The food was really good
The blue corn enchilada and ahi tuna were really good
We waited a while for the entrees to come, that was the only negative thing
I went to Agave the other night with a bunch of friends for a birthday
We came in out of the rain and surprisingly, the bar area was full
I thought everyone would be home!   Anyway, we were seated quickly and given a nice option of tables
What a pretty dining room
Who would've thought? Our waiter was really nice and helped us through with all of our questions
The food came and was great
We had such a nice time and didn't loose our paychecks paying the bill
We've already discussed when to go back
Nice staff, great food, good service
Thank God
I was very excited about going to Agave for lunch after a friend had gone for dinner and highly recommended it
Well, my 3 friends and I were soon disappointed by the terrible, slow service
You would think that if the kitchen is running behind or something, they would offer patrons a drink on the house or dessert
They brought us one teacup sized bowl of chips for the 4 of us, which disappeared within minutes, and didn't replenish our chips until an hour later--after we finally got our food and after we asked them for some more chips 2 TIMES! The waiter couldn't care less that we had to wait so long for everything
So, in turn, we left him a minimal tip--I don't think he deserved one at all
I doubt I'll be going back
The food was good, but it's not worth the wait--or the lousy service
My husband and I brought out of town friends to Agave lastnight and we all enjoyed our meals very much
We ordered guacamole and calamari for apps, both were tasty
I had the shepards pie made with their delicious chili and mac cheese, the others ordered salmon, swordfish tacos, and a chicken dish
We all had a taste of each and agreed that every dish was great
The prickly pear margaritas were wonderful and the large enough to share creme brulee was heavenly
We were happy with the service and the decor was understated and tasteful
I was very excited going to Agave, but was a little disappointed
The interior is a little bland
The food is good but it is what it is and for that, I think it could be less expensive
The presentation of the food is definitely more distinct than in other places of that cuisine
But the taste really isnt
The service was very attentive and friendly
My husband recently won dinner for two to Agave at a Jr
Diabetes Charity Dinner
At first I though, eh, we'll see
We tend to eat out more in mid-town
What an unexpected treat! First of all, the place was beautiful - simple and elegant yet not formal
My husband had the Chili and Enchiladas - very good
I had the Guac and Chicken Quesadillas - excellent
I don't know what I had expected, but I certainly did not expect what we got
The food was flavorful, hot and presented beautifully
Our waiter was very polite and knowledgeable and he suggested this great bottle of wine, a Malbec, that I had never heard of before
And even though we weren't paying for it, the prices were very resonable - great for a group
Anyway, I thougt it was a find and just wanted to spread the word
Atmosphere - warm inviting
Service on top w/o being overbearing
Food was fresh and flavorful - recommend the cerviche! Highly recommended, going again for a perfect night of great food and the jazz scene of the legendary Village Vanguard nearby
It's so nice to enter a restaurant and be welcomed with a smile and the aroma of somethin' amazing going on in the kitchen
After being seated promptly into the cozy adobe-like dining room,  complimentary chips, salsa, olives, and a delicious bean (?) dip arrived
We washed it all down with margaritas (the Agave was tangy and refreshing, and the Prickly Pear was surprisingly sweet and better than any frozen one, hands down)
Appetizers such as the superb guacamole, crab and mole dumplings, and mushroom soft tacos kept us begging for more
As for the entrees, the blue corn and chicken enchiladas with mole were smoky and delicious
Swordfish soft tacos were fresh, light, and excellent
We rounded out the meal with the Mexican vanilla creme brulee--also a treat
Having grown up in New Mexico and Texas, I have to say that Agave reminds me of home
I'll definitely be back
On the recomendation of a friendly villager who frequents Agave I made my first trip on thursday night
They had said that the ambiance had changed slightly with new management but the food and staff has always made time at Agave well spent
The swordfish tacos along with some delightful ceviche, and throw in some Heavenly sort of mango dessert, made for a touch of nirvana
I must admit I was on a date, but was much more interested in the coziness, the music, margaritas and our lovely server named Melissa
The bankhead seating is a little tough on the back but overall, the experience was like a breath of fresh air
(maybe a little more spice in the chowder?) I will see the adobe walls at Agave again soon! Jodi
As soon as I entered Agave, I was taken by the warm lighting and the authentic, southwestern decor
The staff was very welcoming, and provided fast, and friendly service
The guacamoli was great! It was so fresh

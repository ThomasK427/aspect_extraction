The decor is hokey and the ambience is like dining at an amusement park, but it's spacious and the excellent view of Times Square from this decidedly un-New York establishment makes for a pleasantly surreal experience
The shrimp tastes like it's been frozen, though that's what I expected
The two varieties I tried were decent
The portions are very large, so at least you get your money's worth -- the ping pong shrimp appetizer is enough to satisfy most appetites as an entree
So much for it being lightly breaded, though -- I've had General Tso's chicken with less batter on it
I would have to say that this is one of the better Times Square values for family dining, but still just average overall
Girlfriend and I are frequent visitors to the NYC Bubba Gumps
Always have a grand time with the staff (recommended servers: Mark, Julius, Alexis
heck, all of them!)
Try everything!
Horrible experience on my birthday!!! We were told that the wait will be for 15-20 mins
After waiting in the bar for 35 mins
we were told that our turn had not yet come
After another 10 mins
we insisted on checking the log and found that our turn had long been past but no one informed us in the bar
The staff did not even seem to be sorry for their mismanagement!! We chose to leave for another place
I was pleasently surprised to find such excellent service in a city of otherwise rude and aloof people
We all had excellent beverages, entrees and the server was awesome
The ambiance was great after a long day in the city
You felt like you were able to get away from it all even though you have an excellent view of times square
The gift shop is very cute!
I paid $7 for a dish of coconut shrimp at an on-the-water seafood cafe on Cape Cod while I paid $18 for the same amount of coconut shrimp at Bubba Gump's
Granted Bubba threw in some coleslaw and fries, the Cape Cod shrimp had much more flavor and a much better price
That said, my $18 platter was filling, as was my father's Shrimp Po Boy (which was worth its $11)
The service was good, if not better than good (although a bit on the annoying side for an aloof New Yorker), as was the Lava Flow smoothie
Like most other restaurants, I'd probably go there for the dessert and opt for something a little cheaper
The view over Times Square is nothing spectacular -- tourists milling about is nothing new
Visited Bubba Gump one evening, had to wait 15 minutes, but was worth it
Staff was friendly and tried to accommodate any request
The license plates indicating you need service is one of the best ideas I have ever seen and allows to get almost immediate service
Went to Bubba's in february 2004
Loved the food, the price and the service
It is a fun place to eat and overloooks the city
The editorial review for this restaurant is accurate about everything except about the food costing not much
It's expensive! About the usual for a NYC theme restaurant though
There were a couple of less expensive entrees (Fish 'n' Chips for about $12) but most entrees were in the neighborhood of $18
But the food was good, the wait staff made it fun
Avoid the place if you just want to be left alone, but if you want to be entertained it's fun
One last note -- they push the expensive drinks pretty hard, even kids drinks, so just be firm if you don't expensive drinks
Keeping it simple:   great food: I've had almost everything on the menu and it's delicious!  great staff: very pleasant and attentive (esp
love the stop forrest sign concept)  great fun: the staff is a little more hyper at certain times than others but just be prepared for a very lively dining experience
I've never eaten at any of the other Baluchis, just this one
They have a 1/2 price lunch special and the food is awesome and authentic
The decor is great too
I normally eat at the indian places on 6th Street, but those are cra
p compared to this place
The Scene The series of showy white-on-white rooms reverberates with the gregarious chatter of a high-rolling clientele, many laden with Bloomingdale's bags
Tables turn over slowly, so would-be diners mill impatiently in the front bar area
The harried staff is accommodating, but keeps a cool distance
The Food The perplexing menu comprises rich dishes with dubious tweaks, like excellent foie gras terrine with superfluous breaded grapes, and tender scallops gussied up with quail eggs, chorizo oil and lobster foam
A delicious salmon filet benefits from sauteed greens in housemade XO sauce, but not from cloying Chinese sausage
Simple--though still unctuous--pasta with mushrooms is a refreshingly uncomplicated choice
The over-the-top desserts include cheesecake lollipops with a bubblegum-scented dipping cream
Last night a group of girlfriend's and I dined at David Burke Donatella
We had our reservation for a week, but still had to wait half an hour to be seated
The bar area is very small and cramped when crowded, but the decor of the restaurant is fun, unique, and comfortable
Approximately 15 minutes after being seated, we were finally greeted by our captain and proceeded to order a very expensive bottle of wine, that arrived in about another 15 minutes
While the appetizers, entrees, and desserts arrived in a timely manner, our water glasses maintained consistently empty (at one point one of us had to ask for water twice!) and the service simply was not attentive
One of my friend's ordered the veal, which while she said was excellent, came out undercooked and had to be sent back to the kitchen
Nothing was done on the restaurant's part to compensate for this inconvenience
The food itself makes for an interesting dining experience, with hearty twists on American dishes
However, having dined at many fine restaurant's in New York City, I am always happy to pay a pretty price for a great experience
But in my opinion, a great experience doesn't just pertain to food, and an evening of dining is certainly given a bad taste when the service is not up to par
For the price tag here, I would recommend looking into other options of restaurants where you can have just as good, if not better of a meal, and be treated well along with it
I reluctantly made reservations at DBD not expecting too much but urged to go by a friend
I am now thanking her profusely
Ambiance is spot on in spite of the room's smallness with the white and red colors adding a pleasant upbeat quality
A ribeye was perfectly cooked with a great crust and generous in quanity, my wife's chicken the best she has had
Wine by the glass matched the food perfectly
Service was pleasantly efficient, the hostess extremely personable
In spite of previously made comments re: stuffiness, the overall atmosphere was relaxing
Would not hesistate to recommend to other friends visitng New York
host made the other party wait for 20 minutes before realizing that I had actually been seated at the table
The appetizers were truely mediocre in taste
main dishes were much better, desserts were anything you can buy at a mediocre pastry store
The decor is chic and white and red, and the mirrors at a nice broad touch to the small narrow restaurant
Service is unacceptable
From seating to serving to attitude
We waited for over an hour until we got our food, when we complained we were told any second now 3 times
Value was good as we got the prix fixe menu
Just expected a lot more in taste and service given the raving reviews and awards this restaurant has gotten
Call me narrow-minded but I rarely venture above 23rd for dinner
But I am so glad a friend persuaded me go to DBD
The food was amazing
The warm bread, served in a little basket, was delectable
The appetizers were all perfect; the tartare was fresh and flavorful
I loved the Loster Steak
Decadent desserts that were worth the calories
The only negative was the crowd: stuffy and dull
There was a definite air of snobbery in the room - and it certainly couldn't be called relaxing
Also, the coat check is literally on top of the bar
This was uncomfortable and messy
Completely frustrating and not a good way to start or leave a meal
But the service was top notch, and I did love the food
If I find myself uptown again, I'd be quick to stop by
Certain dishes shine - the Lobster steak is delicious and light, with a consistency approaching quiche
The duck and shrimp on vegetable fried rice was flavorful, but not exceptional, and the shrimp was of suprisingly poor quality
The most memorable dish is perhaps the cheesecake lollipops with bubblegum-favored whipped cream, which was wonderful
Overall, it is the service that distinguishes it from other restaurants - but it's a hefty premium to pay for average fare
Terrible service

The black miso cod is to die for! Be sure to get the fruit infused sake for dessert too
I can't wait to go back~!
tuesday at 545pm pre-show dinner - great food - amazing service - was strange to find both at one place! had the $80 chefs tasting menu - was excellent -and we were stuffed - basically is a bit of all of their special dishes - one at a time - with sushi soup coming last
the banana desert was better than any desert ive ever had - no kidding
very pricey
the only bad thing - its mid december - and they had their doors locked until 550pm and wouldn't let anyone in - had to wait in the cold
VERY hard to make reservations - must do it 1 month in advance - and then they only take reservations 1 month in advance! phone is busy a lot -but keep trying
I haven't even BEEN to Nobu but just trying to make a reservation is so aggravating! I have been calling for THREE hours and the phone is busy busy busy
How is that possible? Are they keeping the phone off the hook so customers wanting to make a reservation will think it's a happening place because everyone is calling to make reservations and that's why the phone is busy? It is the most ridiculous thing ever
don't wast your time or your phone bill
All you haters
order go sushi
Leave the tables at a place like this to us
This is written by one who saves up the money to dine finely about once every other month
I have had my share of exquisite meals but don't consider myself overexposed to great food by any stretch
I can say without hesitation that my meal at Nobu ranks in the top 10
I had the $120 prix fixe (thank goodness, because the menu is staggering) and was absolutely stuffed at the end of it
The servers were solicitous and extremely nice to us (we were six total)
And the quality of the food was just great
The place was a little too loud for a large party but 4 or less would be perfect
I think everyone who can afford this place should try it
After reading all the reviews, more than half of the people made awful comments
I went there with a low expectation
Nobu proved them wrong
It was great
Our waiter fast to get our drinks, aptz, and orders
Then our food came out rather quickly and still steaming hot for that matter
I LOVED the Rock Shrimp Tempura, it was practically melting in my mouth
Its been days since I ate there and I still cannot get that dish off my mind
Its a definite place to try
Don't be a hater until you have actually gone to rate this place yourself!! I WILL be dinning there again!!
All hype and no substance best describes this over-rated, phony baloney Japanese eatery
You're greeted, and I use that term lousy here, by surly, unsmiling door-domos who eventually plop you down at an under-sized table, toss you a menu and then scurry off to be snotty to the next party
After a couple of hours, a condescending server will drop by, with the same opening line, Is someone taking care of you? Duh, of course not you moron, don't you see the dust on the table and the gaunt looks on our faces?  The joint is as noisy as NASA's jet propulsion laboratory, but hey that New York chic!  As for the food, at best it is mediocre, unimaginative and over-priced
If you want an enjoyable time, friendly people, pleasant atmosphere, good service and really good Japanese cuisine, this ain't the place!
The best restaurant in the world
Sushi melts in your mouth
The Black Cod is the greatest piece of fish i've ever had in my life
I'm so angry that I signed up citysearch just to write this review! The food is way overpriced!! Whoever says the food here is great obviously never tasted great japanese food before
The only reason they seem to taste so good is because the food is well decorated with its super small portion
Their poor service is second to none
They made us wait even though we made a reservation, the place is noisy, waiters are cracking jokes with each other, the set menu takes 2hrs and a half to finish for a measly 5 dish course
Left in disgust, not even hearing a goodbye from the waiter
A good day in New York was ruined because of this over-priced, over-praised restraurant that only is concerned in looking to impress
Strongly do not recommend this restaurant whoever is looking for an upscale restaurant
Will never come back again
We went to Nobu for my sister in law's birthday and, boy did we get our money's worth!! We splurged and spent more money than we should but it was worth it
Partly because of our server, Bam
Yes
Bam
This guy is so full of personality and it's obvious that he takes pride in his job, which is rare in places like this
I highly suggest that if you go, you ask for Bam
The food was wonderful
It was our first time there and Bam suggested the tasters menu
FANTASTIC! The place itself is a little cramped, but the food, the staff and the service were impeccable
We will defintely be going back
anyone who goes to nobu and eats sushi probably goes to friday's and orders steak
go for the nobu specialties--rock shrimp tempura (both ponzu and creamy spicy sauce), yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, tiradito, sashimi salad, and miso rock cod (in lettuce wraps)
had a great experience at Nobu with just a couple of exceptions
The food was as amazing as everyone expects, and the table captain was remarkably attentive, even standing next to the table to chat with me while my date visited the men's room
The host, on the other hand, made sure to tell us exactly when we had to finish our dinner because they needed the table
I'm sorry? We're paying $300 for a meal and you are going to hustle us out? I don't think so
And the bathroom was untidy, with paper towel litter all over the floor
I believe if you are paying for a high-end dining experience, the *whole* experience should be high-quality, from the greeting you get when you walk in the door to the neatness of the restrooms
It's the attention to details, folks
everything except dessert horrible
We were two couples
not allowed to have different tasting menus, all at the table had to have the same
I asked why and the impolite waiter said that is wht the chef wants
spending $120 should be what the customer wants
The oysters were warm as was the sushi that was served over dry rice
The plates came out like an assembly line
When we asked the waiter to slow down they came faster
When I told him the sushi was warm he removed my plate and never gave me anything else
The palaetswere never described to us,we asked the bus boy who did speak english,our waiter could not be found
With sake and 6 glasses of wine the check was a shocking $789 without tip
my tip to you is stay away
What is up with this place? They say you need a reservation, but when I call in advance they tell me I have to call back in a few days which is exactly one month from the date I want
Then when I call back on that date, all I get is a busy signal
Are these people kidding me??? Do they just leave the phone off the hook all day to drive people crazy?
Don't be fooled by the naysayers
Trust me Nobu on the corner of Hudson and Franklin is still the best restaurant I've eaten at in NYC
Tonight, my wife and I decided to opt out of the omakase and tried to see if the negative could be true
We ordered off the menu
Yellowtail with Jalapeno, Salmon in spicy sauce, Komamoto oysters, Black Cod, Softshell crab roll, Lobster and Shrimp salad, Yellowtail collar, toro and uni
We even had the dessert, fried banana with chocolate dipping sauce
The food was great, service was awesome and the experience fantastic
We walked in by getting there by 6 PM
had a great meal worth every penny
My group of 4 at the last minute turned to 5 and we were running late
Knowing that it's always hard to get a reservation I immediately called to let the staff know of my situation
They were very friendly and accommodating
As soon as we arrived, we were seated, greeted with exceptional customer service and ate the most divine dishes
Nobu has a great system
All restaurants should follow their lead
I was so disappointed by a recent visit to Nobu
After spending $250 on dinner for 2, we were seated at the sushi bar when there we 8 tables open
They were obviously trying to make the place seem like it was booked for the night, when it wasn't and they had a lot of no shows
It's obviously because of the service since when we complained about a foul smell of dirty dishrag at the sushi bar, the manager barely flinched
He was rude and treated us as if we should feel lucky to be eating there

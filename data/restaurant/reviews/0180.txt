I had a dinner where I brought 6 top clients and was horribly embarrassed
Please save your time and money
My most recent visit to Town was superb from start to finish
We actually celebrated Valentine's day there with a tasting menu
The food was executed flawlessly, loved the Foie Gras with Chateau dYquem vinegar, probably the best terrine in Manhattan
Service was not exactly stellar but smooth and considerate (valentine's day probably not the best time to enjoy dining out Anywhere in Midtown, but excellent just the same
We did wait for our table for 30 mins
but once we were seated we enjoyed everything from champagne to Petit fours
I wrote another review but it doesn't look like it posted
If it does, well, then you'll get a more detailed explanation as to why I am so adament about getting my point across
The service (other than out waiter Oren who was a great guy) was horrible
The hostesses were rude and we waited over an hour for our table regardless of our reservation
The food wasn't that great and again, the hostesses were extremely rude
This place is such a rip off it's almost crazy
actually, it is crazy
I still can't believe it
The only pleasant experience was the cigarette after the meal as we waited for a cab
That place can kiss it
i love this spot, the food is full thought and care chef john deserveds his name on the door, town has the best the meat in town from the age rib to the lamb this place shows that it love its customers
What a restaurant! I have always heard about Town but had never had the chance to visit until recently
The design is stunning and the attention to detail on the food is apparent with every bite
Suprising was the cheese selections that were sort of dessert as well
I have been dreaming about my meal (and the cocktails!) since I left
can't wait to go back
I was very excited to go to Town for a nice two hour lunch
The space is beautiful and the service was very good
BUT, my lobster bisque (my favorite soup) was too salty and seemingly had pieces of tofu (i hope)
The chicken was very bland and the polenta that came with it was inedible
It was stuffed into a ring of some pink gooey meat, which was disgusting
Maybe I just ordered wrong, but this pace it's worth the money
I have come here for lunch and dinner
The food is extremely well thought out and delicious
The swordfish was the best I've ever had
The veal tongue was very good
I was told that the raviolo and even the burger were wonderful
Supposedly the duck is better at Tao, but I tried it and was happy with it
The appetizers were also delicious
Most importantly, the food is obviously made with great care
The wine list is nothing short of phenomenal, but few wines if any are under $75
That said, the wine markup is reasonable
Lunch is reasonably priced, but dont expect to pay less than $100 per person for dinner
The food alone is $71
The atmosphere is great, bright and welcoming for lunch and romantic for dinner
Overall, this is the best dining experience Ive had in NYC
Totally wonderful, my boyfriend and I were seated immediatly (had a reservation), the service was perfect and very attentive
The food was very delicious, decor beautiful
A bit pricey, but well worth it
Gotta go
A bunch of my girlfriends and I had heard mixed reviews about town-so we decided to see for ourselves one night-let's just say whoever is writing these nasty reviews on here about this place should quit it-their dishonest remarks could make someone miss out on an opportunity to enjoy such a great place
We had a great time-the service, the food, the overall atmosphere was amazing
A friday or saturday night on the balcony with the ala carte menu, cocktails and dessert is the secret to a great girls night out
Town is the worst dining experience i've ever had
we waited over an hour for overpriced food and mediocre service
Please go somewhere that actually deserves your business
Food is wonderul but portions small for the price
Service is in no way Three Stars
Being in the business, I doubt that anyone there has the expertise for proper service
Everyone is in a nice suit but no one is in sight
Zakarian should make changes
Overall, I am very disappionted that they cannot get service done right
It does no justice to the beautiful but small portions that are served
My server did not even know the dish when he served me
I found myself to be mislead by his reccomendations and wine selection
By the way, wine does not belong on the table cloth
Its better in the glass
The phone system is terrible
Ten minutes on hold to get a reservation and 38 minutes after my reservation that I was seated
It is not acceptable to keep people waiting for over an hour past the time of their reservation for their table--what is the point of making a reservation? The maitre d's position was that we should consider ourselves lucky--some people had been waiting well over an hour
He was not even gracious enough to offer to pay for our cocktails
Some of the dishes were okay, but several were overly complicated
The chef misses the point by drowning dover sole in strong flavors
To top off a terrible evening, the last chocolate souffle was sold 20 minutes before I ordered one--making the inexcusable wait that much more painful
The only redemption is the sommelier and the wait staff
When we arrived we thought the ambiance was nice but it took forever to get a server, our server was never the same, the food was under cooked and to top it off when we told the waitor that we were not happy, he didn't offer to compensate us at all
For a 70$ dinner, I expect a lot more and was very disappointed
There are too many other great places in the city, I would not waste my time there again
Like everone else says, do not miss Town
It is by far one of the best combinations of food, ambience and service in the city
The food blew us away, in particular the desserts are not to miss
Don't leave without ordering the chocolate souffle for 2, it is worth the wait!
Yes, it is expensive, but most of the time it is very much worth it
The service can be a little ditzy if you eat in the lounge area, but service in the dining room has always been top-notch
Go for the food, and try to do it on a corporate card! It's just such a unique room and space, and staying at The Chambers is a great romantic escape- my boyfriend and I do it once a year even though we live in New York
Just don't order room service unless you want to wait an hour and have the wrong thing delivered
What can I say- it was a Sunday afternoon and Sunday's in restaurants are always hit or miss
Very disappointing
The pre-fixe menu is not new to us, but we've never had to pour our own wine until Town
Truly sad
About the food: the lobster bisque was served in a deep bowl so I kept swishing my spoon back and forth in search of the two lobster pieces that were at the bottom of it
Would recommend a more shallow bowl for this 1st course
Town needs larger mussels, perhaps Mediterranean, because even the Prince Edwards are not worthy as a dish on the menu at all
My skate wing was so-so, but was truly over-powered by the amount of greens that were on my plate
Noticeably a large staff with light duties, barely worth a hubbub for all the hustle
ESPECIALLY since we had to pour our own wine all evening
To end on a good note: great pastry chef and the wine selection was good
I was very disapointed with town! With a reservation i waited 45 minutes
I guess to make up for my wait, i was supposed to be impressed with the cheap glass of champagne, the rude waitstaff , and the so so food
Wow sign me up again! I do not recomend town to anyone!
Went to Town and was not that impressed
It took a while to be seated (even though I had reservations) so we went for a drink at the bar

The design is very intimate and romantic
The food was wonderful and imaginative
The staff is very sharp and they look good too
In Short This extension of the Cleaver Company, an agriculturally conscious caterer, has a rustic refinement, with two wooden banquet tables and three tables for two dressed with seasonal centerpieces
Fresh market veggies, locally farmed cheeses and other organic ingredients combine into a changing menu that's big on soups, salads, house-cured salmon, mini-pizzas and burgers, as well as various pot pies
Ginger doughnuts, organic coffees, beers and wines enhance the selection
Green Table is very nice (and smalll) restaurant with a nice selection of good food and organic wines
I've been there several times and have never been disappointed with the food or the service
My only complaint is that Green Table is in Chelsea Market, which is nice-looking and has a bunch of interesting-looking places, but since you're inside, it lacks NYC street energy
Put it anyplace else in the city, and it would be a truly great place - but then again, if you do that, you might not be able to get a seat
The Green Table has become one of my favorite restaurants
The menu is crafted around seasonal organic/bio-sustainable ingredients so there are always new offerings
Every dish I have had there has been amazingly fresh and creative
I highly suggest starting off with the Mezze Plate, 5 or so bite-sized amuses-bouches, and ending with the warm ginger donuts
Whatever you order, you'll be happily surprised by the outstanding quality of the food
Definately a must-try
Like a tiny piece of Chez Panisse in Chelsea
The Green Table is a wonderful little tasting room that showcases organic and healthy foods, and Margaret is a wonderfuly talented chef
Her imagination shows with the flavor combinations she uses, combining sweet with savory, using reductions and infusions, and using flavors to draw out other flavors without overpowering
The wine list is small, but suits the menu
I like the fact that it's a very small place, it's all about quality not quantity
I hope this trend continues, the NYC restraunt industry really needs some reinvigorating
And since it's in Chelsea Market, it's the perfect place to stroll and shop after such inspiring food
The Scene Sangria sippers and guacamole dippers arrive early to score a sidewalk table at Maria's, the one fun spot along Union Street's drab residential stretch
Inside, the tiny brick-wrapped room is candlelit, with wine glasses on wood tables, sepia-toned photos and a corner bar where tireless bartenders mash mint for mojitos all night
Attentive servers replenish chips, salsa and spicy sauteed mussels, while bouncy Mexican pop fuels a feel-good vibe
The Food The menu isn't as upscale as the setting--and that's a good thing
Simply prepared Mexican classics, like gooey cheese-stuffed poblano rellenos, fresh enchiladas and cocoa-spiced grilled chicken mole, are fantastic with rice and bean sides
Paella is a more refined success, stocked with shrimp, buttery scallops, chicken breast and chorizo
Elaborate diversions can disappoint
Chunky onions overwhelm the seviche; jamon serrano can be too dry; and casserole-baked red snapper, though moist and fresh, arrives smothered with bland tomato-onion sauce
The service at the beginning was great
The guacamole was fantastic and fresh
Wine was great
The chips and salsa were not overflowing or refilled like typical Mexican restaurants
Steak dinner- wait was there any steak actually on the plate? The portions of the duck dish were sad
Even the rice and beans were not plentiful
Although the service seemed great at the beginning, that declined
Waitress took our orders and we didn't see her again until the bill came
Very anticlimatic
Incredibly small portions for price!
Start with great (and potent) margaritas along with delicious guacamole made as mild or as hot as you like
Move on to one of the specials (like the shrimps with goat cheese), the chicken mole, or the chicken or beef served with tortillas and all sorts of incredibly flavorful ingredients in a black stone pot
This place is really good
And the service is much improved from awhile back
My husband and I are from Texas, and this is, by far, the most authentic Mexican food we've found in the City
Anyone who turns their nose up at Maria's doesn't enjoy flavourful, fresh Mexican food and drinks
We live in Manhattan and come all the way to Maria's as often as possible!!! We are obsessed with their Chilli Rellenos, or Pablanos, the margaritas, sangria and the fresh guacamole
If you've yet to grasp the message, we think this restaurant is fabulous, we love everything about it!!!
There're a couple of superior Mexican places in Park Slope/Carrol Gardens section and Maria's has been mentioned as one of them, I was not thoroughly impressed
First of all the space is adorable and the location off of 4th Avenue is refreshing
The margarita tasted home-made, but it was way too sweet
The shrimp ceviche was pretty standard, spicy, lime-y and tad too tomatoey, but the shrimp seemed strangely mangled for some reason
I was not happy with the grilled vegetable salad, that had carelessly large and oily bits of peppers and onions on top of an unimaginative pile of mesculin mix
The enchiladas with chicken were bland and forgetable
The waitress was a little spacey, asking us if we had our starters way after we finished them and were already on our mains; but the busboys were at the table every few minutes trying to clear our dishes
Don't make a reservation
they seat who they want
I noticed my name was crossed off the list and another couple who came after me was seated in my place
Not even an apology for the mistake!  A guacamole that was too salty started the evening and the margaritas are so strong, you only need one to party! The waitress was sweet (her first day) but when my food arrived I was dissapointed
Salmon with a spicy orange sauce, but where the spices went I am still trying to figure it out! The portion was barely 4 ounces and had very little taste
Nothing special at this restaurant except the rather over-inflated bill for under seasoned dishes
Finally getting around to writing this (have been going there over a year)
good service wheather inside or outside
Food has ALWAYS been of quality (don't have the guacmole they can't seem to make it spicy enough) hot (not many places seem to know how to do that today)
Very romantic with the Mexican coffee (at least 3) the night always ends on the plus side
My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for a while now, and it is awesome
We bring all our friends here and they fall in love this it
We have Never had a bad experience here, ever! The food is great and drinks outstanding - you have to have their Sangria, oh my gosh!
We thought this was a cute looking place and we finally had a chance to eat there recently
Quite frankly, the cooking is better then it has any right to be for the price
When we left, we thought that this is the Mexican Al Di La, which if you are from the neighborhood you know is the highest form of praise
The cooking here is done at a very high level
If you are looking for mountains of cheese, huge portions, and frozen margaritas made with cheap hooch, then go elsewhere
This is serious Mexican food presented in an elegant manner in a beautiful little spot
We will be back
Great small, quant mexican restaurant
The service is attentive and pleasant
The food is presented excellent and taste great
Flavorful and and exotic
I would defintaly go back
Excellent (if pricey) guac
Service was incredibly attentive
Small, quiet, romantic
Never thought I could enjoy sitting that close to 4th Ave! I would definitely go back
5th Avenue is swarming with great places to eat, and now 1 block further away there's a great new Mexican that's well worth the trip
Great food, terrific service, and the best guacamole I've had in ages
Oh, excellent cocktails too
not much else on this rather desolate block, so you have to know to go there
and do go! warm orangey glow, nice old mexican prints, wee bar that my bf and i vowed to go back and linger at
at the first glance, the menu appears to offer not a lot more than Mexican Standards -- and that's basically what it does offer -- but at a quality FAR better than we're used to settling for
everything is prepared -- and served -- with great care and attention to detail
eg: a PERFECT pear on a salad, an artfully table-filleted red snapper
only drawback was--oddly--tepid, watery salsa
we were thoroughly charmed
please go and spread the word; these guys are totally earnest and adorable and i want to support them!
The Scene The colorful, energetic space--with its wrought-iron and tile bar, mosaic ceiling and Madison Park locale--couldn't be more ideal for enjoying excellent snack-sized plates and a nice array of wines by the glass
Service is swift and knowledgeable
The Food Don't even bother with large plates; start grazing on the 30-odd small plates instead
Bhoondi raita (crispy chickpeas in cumin-yogurt sauce) and gobhi masala (cauliflower in ginger-cumin tomato sauce) are perfect for soaking up with rosemary naan, the standout bread among many contenders

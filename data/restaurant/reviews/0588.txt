I have tried almost all of the dishes on the menu and I dare say this is the best Japanese restaurant in town by quality/value
I dare say I am well-experienced with Japanese food (travel to Japan many times), and the cuisine here is very genuine
Best kept secret in town! It's sad to see that so few people know about this place - try it!
My Chelsea's impressive and creative menu includes modern, Westernized Japanese dishes such as Foie Gras Unagi Napolean, Jap style hamburger steak, spicy cod roe spaghetti, black cod with miso base, and rack of lamb in black truffle sauce, to name a few
First-timers are recommended to explore their $25 prix fixe five course menu, which I would strongly insist as the best-kept dining secret in New York
Desserts are almost incredible: my personal favorite is their Tart of the Day
Good service, great food, good value, and never have to wait in line! It's worthwhile to take a cab to Chelsea just for an awesome dinner at My Chelsea
I recently went to Angus's on a weeknight around maybe 8:30
I hadn't been there since late February or so and WOW what a difference
I loved the food before but now (and apparently the new chef David just got started a few months ago) it's extraordinary
First of all the main menu has such a variety of food from NY strip steak to an out of this world veggie lasagne
BUT, here's the kicker
The specials!! I recently had a roasted chicken sandwhich that had a roasted yellow pepper pesto
There's so many, too many to list, unique dishes this chef has put together
I had an appetizer, entree, and dessert for under $50!!! Show me that anywhere else in the city, especially with that food quality, for that little
My date and I had a little corner table and it was like the place was ours
If you go to Angus's and you want a quiet meal go around 8:30 and you can chill for a couple of hours with no crowds
Anyone who can make a delicious beet salad wins my heart
I agree with a lot of the other reviews here
The restaurant itself was classic and lovely
On a beautiful summer evening, we sat by the open doors looking out at the theaters opposite
Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, and attentive
The food was awesome! We had an appetizer with lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels and oysters
The sauces served were inventive and original
Because there is (according to the waiter) a new chef, we were delighted with a huge selection of specials to choose from along with the standard dinner menu
We both chose from the specials
We were both elated with our meals and since we had to taste each other's, I can say that my tuna, along with her pasta was the real deal
Finally we shared a lemon tart with this almond butter crust that just made my night
The food was plated well and tasted even better
Good job new chef! :)  I read other posts about it being crowded, but we went on a Monday night and it wasn't busy at all! I couldn't believe it
Apparently, if you go on a Monday night or at eightish, you can avoid the crazy theater rush
I will definitely be back!
I see all of these wonderful reviews and wonder what went wrong with mine
Our server was friendly enough, but he never brought any bread after he offered it and I had to catch him so I could get a drink refill as it sat empty all through my meal
The food was awful
The shrimp dim sum was the same cheap kind that you buy from the frozen section of your supermarket
I ordered what was the full English breakfast and for my $14 I was treated to chewy overcooked eggs, a burned portobello mushroom top, pasty potato cakes, VERY undercooked baked beans and sausage and bacon that were both cold and hard as rocks
It was a mystery how this happened as the food came quickly
Can you say premade and barely microwaved food, folks? I think we can
Worst
Experience
Ever
I dont another place of this food quality and abidance in the Theatre District let alone in all of NY for the price
Food is great but you better make a reservation
I have been there many times and have never been let down
The best surprise is one night I had a craving for raw clams on the half shell
When I asked the waiter how good they could be since this was not a Fish Restaurant, he enthusiastically claimed they were great
I'm very happy I took his advice and ordered a dozen
They were the best clams on the half shell I ever had
Enjoy
I have been to this restaurant a total of three times and each time has been better than the last
Most recently I hosted a birthday dinner there and it was fabulous
Requested and received a round table for ten people on the mezzanine level
We received personal service from an excellent waiter and at the end of it all with appetizers, entrees, and drinks, te whole bill topped out at only 450 plus tip! Excellent restaurant! A tip for all
come in after 7:30 when the pre-theater crowd has already cleared out
then you'll really receive excellent service above and beyond the already impeccable treatment
If you're going to see The Producers this is the pre-theatre spot
right next door, literally, to the St
James
Good service, excellent food, and a nice atmosphere
A little crowded but the spirits are good, so who cares? Well worth a trip
We'll be back
We dined here last weekend before we saw Avenue Q, one block over
We had such a great experience, we'll definitely be back! The food was delicious, the service spectacular and the prices extremely reasonable, especially for midtown
For three entrees, three desserts, an appetizer and several drinks, our bill came to only about $150
Can't wait to go again!
I was disappointed in our trip to this restaurant
Although my food was excellent my dinner partners were somewhat disappointed
With no prix-fixed menu the expense jumped rather quickly as ala carte items(salads and 2 desserts) were added bringing our bill for four to nearly $200 with only three drinks
One of my pet peeves is that restaurants in New York refuse to issue separate checks to couples dining together
It would make their patron's life so much easier with so little effort on their part! Also despite assurances that we were in plenty of time(6:30PM) for an 8:30 show (Producer- next door) it took forever to get the waiter to get our check to us and paid, so we rushed out at 7:59
Lastly the table was wobbly and cramped
As part of a bus group trip into the city, we chose Angus Mcindoe's based on a recommendation from someone at Joe Allen's
We needed accommodations for 50 people and Angus was able to give us the third floor of his restaurant for our entire party
I can't tell you how surprised we were both by the quality of the food and the quality of the service
This is a great find on theatre row and I'm so happy I found it
I now mention it to everyone I know who's going to a show
This place is a find within this area, or anywhere for that matter
The service was friendly, the atmosphere was relaxed, and the food was really good
When I think of Times Square I think of gaudy, touristy places
This had me feeling that I was in the West Village getting ready to see some live Jazz, not The Producers
What was even better was that it was that expensive
Angus Mcindoe, the former fabulous and friendly manager of Joe Allen's, has opened up his own place, right next to The Producers home, and it's really great
The space is terrific, boasting three stories; two for dining and the third is a nice bar scene
The ever-smiling Scotsman Mcindoe really makes you feel like you're his best friend stopping in for a bite at his place
There is a nice feta cheese salad, a great filet and, fantastic mussels, and the monkfish I had was to die for
And it's all pretty reasonable
And you never know who you might see
Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane are investors in the place!
Ate here based on what I read on this site, so thought I'd return the favor
Four of us arrived around 4:30, right after a matinee and we had the place entirely to ourselves
By 5:30 it was packed, so I suggest reservations
The great thing was our server never made us feeled rushed and he was funny
The four meals included the risotto w/shrimp, penne w/sausage, quiche, and vegetables w/polenta
I had the vegetables and wasn't very please especially with the price
However, everyone else raved about their meals
So, poor choice on my part
It was still a nice experience and we got to see a lot of The Producers cast eating dinner between shows, which is always neat even if you want to be coorl and don't want to admit it!  It was a little more expensive than I expected, so just keep that in mind
The Scene Along with friend Kelly Tisdale, pop-electronica sensation Moby has turned a former hair salon into this relaxed, modern snack shop
The bright space seats about 20, and is often packed with neighborhood residents, tourists and socially conscious teens

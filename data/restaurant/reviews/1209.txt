Definitely something to check out
Make sure and try the udon - mmm
For Brooklyn, the prices and freshness of the sushi cannot be beat
The owner, Sano, is extremely nice and he has a very authentic Japanese restaurant
Try the dragon roll!
Taro Sushi NY - a companion restaurant to the home restaurant in Tokyo lies right near Atlantic Station off Flatbush at Dean St
As a small restaurant with only 6-7 tables and a sushi bar, this local fav isn't a place to bring large parties but it is simply one of the best sushi spots in brooklyn
The sushi chef, trained in Japan, knows his fish and it shows in the3 typical and not-so-typical dishes he turns out for the regulars
Get to know the chef, and he will create special things for you that are delicious and unique
from the sashimi to the rolls, to the good selection of sake to the daily specials direct from Japan
If you are in bklyn, go to Taro Sushi it doesn't get any better than this
I enjoy going to this cafe (upstairs) from time to time
You get great views of Soho and it's less expensive than some of the surrounding restaurants
Yes, the service is a little relaxed, but I recently managed to be in and out of there in about 30 to 40 minutes (informed my waiter we were in a rush- it was no problem
) Overall, this is not a bustling place
If that is what you are going for, try Jerry's (another good choice)
I have always found the waitstaff friendly if not 100% attentive
This is a nice place to have a yummy sandwich or salad with a glass of wine, and enjoy
Rude rude staff
My boyfriend and I waited 30 minutes before the waitress came over to take our order
There is only one waitress for the entire upstairs
I saw many unsatisfied customers around me
When we got up to leave, the waitress was extremely rude
This place is disorganized and understaffed
Never again will I dine here
Nice cafe spot for a quick late breakfast or lunch nosh
Food was flavorful with fresh herbs
Prices are reasonable for this quality food
Quite a pleasant lunch!
You will not find 67 dinners on the menu, but everything that you do find is excellent
I can't say that I have tried everything yet
The 4 different meals that I have had there have been great
I also learned that the owner is the artist of all the art work on the walls which is pretty good
This is such a welcome addition to the upper eastside of NYC
A true gem of a restaurant
A limited menu but the aim is obviously quality not quantity
The 16 oz
Natural Grazed steak from Maine is absolutely fantastic!!!
The whole grilled fish - delicious! And the specials and the gourmet burgers are the best in the city! Definitely a place you will come back to again and again
My husband and I used to go to Cal's years ago, and I think this adorable little boite is even better
It is so intimate and elegant, just what our neighborhood needs
343 and Ian's are among the only places I truly love in this area
The Amish chicken is delicious, and the wait staff is friendly and accomidating
My husband's steak was delightful
I highly recommend it, but be sure to make reservations to aviod long waits
I CONFIRMED RESERVATION IN PERSON
WHEN WE ARRIVED,WE WERE TOLD WE HAD NO RESERVATION
WE WERE THEN SAT IN SIBERIA WITH NO APOLOGY
THE SERVICE WAS INDIFFERENT
THE OWNER COULD NOT BE BOTHERED TO APPROACH OUR TABLE
THE HOSTESS HAD ATTITUDE DESPITE THEIR MISTAKE
WE MAKE BETTER STEAKS AT HOME
WE LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND WILL NOT PATRONIZE 343 AGAIN
WILL PATRONIZE OTHER LOCAL ESTABLISHMENT WITH OWNERS WHO ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR PATRONS
My wife and I enjoyed a delicious dinner at 343
Set on quiet tree-lined E85th street, its away from the crowds
We arrived without a reservation, but were warmly greeted and seated
Service was efficient and friendly
They paid attention to detail: Crisp linen, polished flatware, elegant glasses, 3 types of rolls, high-quality butter and olives
All good signs
My wife's vegetable tarte and my black angus dry-aged steak were superb
The steak came with a baked potato and sour cream with chives
Most interesting was the serving of still-in-the-bone marrow
You don't see this often and would appeal to meat connosieurs!  We shared a side of sauteed asparagus and their delicious banana pudding for dessert
Overall, delightful! Drawback: The menu is limited
Probably no more than 5 appetizers and 6 main courses (4 of 6 were beef
The others were chicken and fish)
Despite this, we'd defintely go again
I went it for Lunch with a client of mine a few weeks ago I am anxiously awaiting my return for Dinner tonight!  The mexican corn app was so yummy
I had the Tuna burger thing with the perfect amount of wasabi on it
Good sangria, fruit could have been a bit more marinated but that's really my only Con
Vibe, setting music were full of flava! It was nice and refeshing to be in a new place that just gets it
First off, the service was excellent! Our server was most pleasant and very helpful
The sangria is just OK
But the food is another story
yummy! My favorite was the yucca w/ the special sauce that's finger lickin' good! The flan is so delicious I thought my abuelita was in the kitchen! The chocolate souffle was fantastic as well
The multi-colored chips that are served w/ the salsa are addictive because of the salt/pepper/? mix that's speckles them
A+
Not only is this resturant situated in the trendiest spot in town, the ambience is fabulous! Being of Argentinian decent, the food wasn't exactly like home but, it came pretty damb close to it
Besides the staff being extremely good looking, they are friendly and courteous! There was this one really nice man with sandy brown hair, Dean, or Dino, who made sure that everyone was being taken care of, he must have been one of the owners and believe me, its worth going to Besito just to look at him
All in all this place is fabulous to come for dinner and drinks with the girls, with you're date and if you're looking for a place to rekindle your Marriage, this would be the spot! Belive me ladies, the price is right, and the staff and the food are both delish!!!
The setting is nice in SoHo, the ambience is great as the restaurant flows out onto the busy W
Broadway, the restaurant is very nicely/classicly decorated Latin style
The wait staff was extra friendly and our service was great
The place, however, had an air about it that something was wrong
sortof like the air was out of the balloon
The wait staff was all hanging at the bar, lounging around
A few listed menu items were not available on a Saturday night at 7pm??? Seems like the ship is sinking I think I know why
it's simply the food, it was average
not bad, not good
Which doesn't fly in SoHo nor for those types of prices
The presentation was very basic as well
The atmosphere truly is special
It has all the makings for a perfectly, cozy spot in the city
Previous reviews about the champagne sangria are right on, its phenomenal!! The chimichanga was freshly cooked and the salsa it was presented on had a great flavor, but I thought the Latin food was average
The plantains were too green and not well prepared
I will most likely give it another shot and try a different Latin dish next time, but right now, Im saying, stick to the more traditional Mexican options that they offer
I would go back for the sangria!
I went to Besito for a birthday party last night and had the best time
If you like Spanish, Mexican or Cuban food you have to go there! They also make the BEST champagne sangria

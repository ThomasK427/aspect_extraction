Food was so affordable and high quality! The service was impeccable
and the ambiance was so relaxing and trendy at the same time
I tried their brunch today
and it was fabulous
The brunch menu has so many different foods to offer
I was so impressed as were my friends!
Upon entering the restaurant I was greeted by the smell of delicious food and a pleasant ambience
Unfortunately things went down hill from there
The hosts were pretentious to put it nicely and I had the NY strip steak which was average (definitely not worth the $24 price)
With so many other restaurants to choose from in NYC, I would not put Whym on a must visit list
A new restaurant needs to carry itself beyond the initial buzz and attract repeat customers - a goal I doubt Whym will accomplish
I ate at this new hot spot last weekend, and I was greeted with a very rude man at the door
I was fored to wait at the very tight bar space even though there were many tables open! When I finially sat, the food was good
I had duck raviolli and my date had the huge pot pie
I recommend sharing the pot pie
way too big for one person
Nice space, although the bar is insane
Last night I visited this gem with my fiancee and we had a terrific date
We both decided upon the $40 Prix-Fixe Valentine's Menu
It was a spledid choice and left our tummy completely satistifed! Try the Shrimp Tamale as a starter, the NY Steak for entree and for desert the Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla ice cream
The ambiance is wonderful and when the lights dimmed
it was even more romantic
It's very Crate Barrel inspired
Staff are very helpful and friendly
What more can you ask for? This is a great find! Must check it out
This place was a Bodega just a few months ago
I had to go see what was done to it, and i was very surprised
the Room was very sexy, the menu was fun and very well prepared, the service was professional and a great little winelist and cocktail selection
The staff is super friendly and accomodating here at Whym
They know how to treat thier clientelle
Both the dinner and wine menu have a nice international flare
Will definitely be back to this intimate and trendy little hot spot
This place is great! I had the Pot Pie and was totally blown away
Sexy space, friendly knowledgeable servers and fabulous food
The chocolate cake was amazing too
I cannot wait to come back! Thanks for moving in to the neighborhood
I had read about the opening of Whym online and decided to be the guinea pig
Not only was our food delicious, the atmosphere fun (trendy, but SO not obnoxious), but the staff was friendly, accommodating, and gave excellent recommendations! Oh yeah, don't forget to try the peanut butter martini for dessert!
I LOVE dokebi! The food is awesome and it's so fresh
The seaweed salad is really good, and so is the mushroom stir-fry and vegetable table grill
I've tried a lot of different dishes there, and I haven't been disappointed by a single one
I love the atmosphere-it's not typical korean, they play great music, and they've got a bar in the back
WITH more than just johnnie black and coors light, like most places in ktown! (boo) Also, the place is really clean
I peeked into the window of the kitchen, and wow, I was impressed
It gets pretty busy on the weekends, and I can see why
It's a fun place to eat and hang out with your friends, or even for family dinners
I would definately recommend this restaurant to anyone who's a fan of korean food
Oh, and the fig and hazelnut ice cream is delicious
finally something a bit different - not traditional and not wanna be yuppie, a good fit for the neighborhood
food is better than average, the detail in the decor is pretty fascinating and overall vibe is great
they even have a bar scene
After having read a couple of negative reviews, I had been avoiding Dokebi, but several american friends of mine finally talked me into going there for dinner last week
They all spoke so highly of it after having been so i went
The place has a really offbeat feel to it and it's not what I would have expected from a korean place even in Williamsburg
over all, the food was pretty delicious, the service was as good as any place i've been to around here, and i really had a great time there
i'm a little annoyed for having avoided this place as long as i have, considering how much i really like korean food
Either the place has changed drastically or the some of the negative reviews were a bit off?  I recommend this place for anyone who likes korean food but doesn't want to deal with korea-town
Disregard some of those negative reviews and go in with no expectations and you will be pleasantly surprised
:)
wasn't sure what they were, cause they didn't have a sign or anything, but it was packed
i soon discovered why
the food is great and they have excellent beers
the crowd is laid back, ecclectic and local
the music is awesome
the decore is unpretentious and filled with hand crafted woodwork
i'm korean-american and know the food very well
they do things a bit different there, but everything on their menu is yummy! they've created a great restaurant which doesn't fit the typical korean BBQ mold
they've taken authentic dishes and presented them in an tasteful setting with a great selection of spirits and GOOD TASTING beers
also, read some unfavorable reviews of the place and seriously puzzled
try it for yourself
it's different from 32nd street (on purpose)
You call this Korean Food
you must be drunk
talk about flavor or lack of flavor
and the Tiny Portions of so called Angus beef nice try with the name it just the same type of beef used in most Korean restaurants except the portions are so small you are embarrassed to your guest
Over priced, service is slow, and Most important the Food is not Traditional Korean
they don't even give you any side dishes
you have to pay for it
outrageous
I've been to Dokebi probably ten times
The Food is awesome
I've gotten something different each time
The table grills are great if you're on a date or with a big group of people
I highly recommend the Bulgohki bibimbahp in the DolSut, cooked in this stone couldron
Also, the bar (which has its own entrance on north 1st) is very cool and a good place to get drinks even if you're not eating
A good sake selection, hot and cold
Good draft beers
Good service
Cool eclectic music selection
Also, lots of cute girls to be seen at Dokebi
I've been there about 20 times and everytime has been an absolute pleasure
They don't do things like all of the places on 32nd st
(thank g-d)
the food is excellent and all made in house of amazing ingredients
the owner told me they avoid MSG like the plague and it shows in the clean fresh taste of the food
they have a REAL beer selection instead of the b/s selection at the other korean places in the city
I love this place and it's so fun to hang out there
i was very excited to hear that there was a korean restaurant in williamsburg so i decided to take a friend there for his birthday dinner
the decor was a little mismatched, the lighting kept changing, and the music was all over the place
i ordered the kimchi sampler, steak cubes, and boolgolgi on the grill

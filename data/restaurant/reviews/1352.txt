Using the best of DeanDeluca's premium roast coffess, this small cafe, run by a very very nice fellow from Tokyo, offers an array of enjoyable coffee drinks and much more
Gotta try their lemonade which is nothing like you've had before
I promise
And if you're from Europe, Cafe Baron will make all drinks to your order, and even Cappuccino the Italian way
Ans they've go the best sandwiches and salads in town
Fresh, tasty, and addictive
And don't forget to check out their specials
Last week was a garlic shrimp plate
Hmm
excellent
And there steack burger in stronagoff sauce (much like a premium meat loaf) is nothing like you've tasted before
Bona petite !!!!
This newly open cafe in hoboken serves Dean and Deluca coffee, for those tired of Starbucks
The food was excellent, created by a Japanese chef
Price is much lower than the city
From the outside, it seems like a typical coffee shop, with Dean Deluca products stacked by the window
but as you walk in, a colorful menu awaits
from great looking California Rolls, to spicy chicken with ginger and soy sauce
the price is also very reasonable
you can get a great pasta with a side of mashed potatoes for only $7
and yes there is an ecclectic mix of food for everyone and it's totally worth it
the chef is Japanese, and he's travelled around the world seeking simple but delicious meals that you won't want to miss!!! The bar also has a great surplus of great coffee and exotic tea
try their special lemonade
and OBA #508
a definite MUST for this summer
As a Brooklynite
I won't have a problem commuting to NJ for this wonderful new Hoboken secret
I envy the people in Hoboken
I have no idea what Truly Disappointing is talking about
The gnocchi was amazing-perfectly cooked, soft and perfectly dressed with a light touch of Parmessan
The main courses were to die for (I had a slow cooked whole baby pork)
The waitress was outstanding
If any of you have HD channels, watch out for Maremma on Daniel Bouloud's show After Hours

Went here the other night, and it was very enjoyable
The waitress was excellent, and there is a nice wine selection from the Maremma region
All of the dishes we had were very good, but the fries were a little on the salty side, which we actually didn't mind
Desserts were also good, especially the coconut tapioca
A nice change from other restaurants in the neighborhood
Give credit to Maremma for trying something different on the Italian cuisine
I had the goat special which was terrific and generous
Companionn's fish was perfectly cooked
Apps are smallish but flavors were all clean and presentations/preparations not overly fussy
The room disappoints a bit, managing to be cold despite the colorful walls--at least upstairs
If it had been more full it proably would have been noisy and/or hot
Service was nice, not overly hovering nor absent-minded
If only for the constantly crying baby on the first floor
Another thumbs up for an improvment over Beppe which had really gone downhill
I read about it in New York Magazines Best issue today and went tonight since it is so close to home
The service was outstanding!
The food was unique, full of flavor and just enough
We left feeling satisfied and enjoyed the beautiful walk home on West 10th
I was suprised when a friend and I had dinner at Maremma
After all I had read, I was expecting a bit of a theme-style restaurant though that was hardly the case
Some of the dishes were named with some cowboy style, but it seemed to be a casual, comfortable Italian restaurant
I ordered Tuscan flapjacks as a starter and my friend had the house made sausages, both were well prepaired and delicious
I had the meatloaf for an entree, it was also very tasty though a bit spicy
Overall this is a great restaurant find
My friend and I decided to try Maremma after having read several reviews praising this tuscan/cowboy themed restaurant
We made reservations, but were annoyingly sat right by the noisy kitchen (even while practically the entire restaurant was empty)
The waitress was overly informative--her pre-dinner speech probably lasted a good 5 minutes and was recided like some sort of theme park audio tour
We ordered two pasta dishes (the riggatoni and the gnocci) in addition to an appetizer
When the food arrived it was nothing short of disappointing
The sauces are plain and made without heart
The cheese was overly infused to cover up poor cooking
Maybe Maremma is more of a meat place, but for a Tuscan restaurant to fail with simple pasta dishes? There is no excuse
This place won't last another month
Love it! Excellent service, atmosphere and great food
Italian comfortfood at it's best
Went for a Sunday brunch
Very tasty dishes
Good wine selection at reasonable prices
Interior colorful and good natural lighting and very spatious
Hearty meat dishes
If you love Spaghetti Westerns and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is a favorite -Maremma is for you!The restaurant is one of the coolest places I've ever eaten at - the spaghetti western decor - just makes you grin
The grin widens as you read the menu with its catchy food choices like 'Wild Boar Coyote' and 'Tuscan Mess Kit'
But the real treat is the food itself - a little spicey - not the usual Tuscan cuisine - but absolutley fabulous!! Congratulations to Chef Casella!
I recently accompanied three friends of mine to have brunch at this new Italian restaurant
To make a long story short, this is the best brunch I've ever had
period
The waiter told us that in Italy, they don't really have a brunch, so the chef mixed the traditional food that comes out of the region Maremma is located in, with the typical American brunch staples (eggs, sausage, etc
)
The result is a spectacular mix of unexpected flavors (like macaroni and cheese with jalapeno), as well as an ambiance that is cowboy culture meets Southern Tuscan charm
The staff was knowledgeable and friendly
The wines they suggested complimented the meal perfectly
The best part? I've heard dinner is even better!
I live in the West Village and had been told by a few friends to check out the new restaurant, Maremma
I finally stopped in for dinner last night and WOW what a find! Please go and support this restaurant as it deserves to become a mainstay in the neighborhood
It's family run, extremely friendly and hospitable, great wine list, and most importantly unbelievable food
I highly recommend the dish, Coyote as well as the basil garlic french fries, fried chicken, and tuna steak
Best of luck to Maremma in it's first few months
great food, bad music, good nieghborhood newcomer recomend all pastas, great desserts
The food was absolutely fabulous from the seafood appitizer to the apple struddel dessert
We ordered the steak for three which was cooked exactly how we ordered it and it was extremely tender
The one nice aspect of the resturant is when they served the steak, it was already cut and arrange around the bone
This made it much easier to serve with no mess

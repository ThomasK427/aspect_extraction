Low-carb dieters stay home
I have never walked out of a restaurant before in my entire life-- and this particular branch of Sophie's compelled me to do so
It was only after 50 minutes of being completely and entirely ignored (not even asked what we wanted to drink) that we decided to leave
I have no intentions of going back
I can't imagine how one can successfully run a business this way
SERVICE IS HORRENDOUS AT BEST
OURS WAS A PARTY OF 7 AND WHEN WE ARRIVED
THEY SEATED AN ASIAN PARTY WHO ARRIVED AFTER WE DID
IN ADDITION, THE FOOD WAS QUESTIONABLE AT BEST
I HAD TO GET UP AND TELL THE WAITER TO REFILL OUR GLASSES OF WATER
HORRIBLE SERVICE AND FOOD
WHY BOTHER
SUSHI SAMBA IS THE WAY TO GO
Looking forward to a light lunch of sushi rolls, my sister and I dropped into Sushi Park after being unable to locate a more familiar restaurant
The menu seemed reasonable and the lunch deal for half off sushi was tempting
We both ordered maki
When it arrived, however, the quality of the fish was immediately put into question
The fish appeared to be pureed, possibly filled with mayonaise, and smelled fishy
As we sat there, these 'tuna' smoothies sank into their rice casings
We were appalled
When we complained about these way it was prepared, saying we'd never seen maki that wasn't in solid pieces of fish, one of the three waiters shrugged and said we got what we ordered
Waitstaff was rude and unwilling to make a substitution or refund when we made it clear that we found it unacceptable
We grudgingly paid our check and left a great deal of food uneaten
I highly discourage anyone from trying this restaurant
There are plenty of authentic japanese restaurants in the Village; this is not one of them
This place is known for their half price sushi but really when you think about it
it's about almost the same price you would have paid at any other sushi restaurant
maybe a dollar or two cheaper
Just be careful of what you order b/c not everything is half off
Service is not great either
i really wanted to like this place due to the lower than average prices
but after a few tries ( and too many stomach aches ) i've sworn them off
if you're looking for affordable decent sushi, try sandobe ( 10th 1st ave ), down the street instead
Sushi park is crowded and packed during most of their discount (50% off) nights
The old adage you get what you pay for bolds true here, as the sushi lacks flavor, small in size, and is dry giving the impression that isn't fresh
The service was as so-so as their sushi, feeling rushed to order and leave often and not being as attentive or personable as they should be
The ambience is not bad, considering their location
The wooden chairs / tables make for a nice feel but the service and food greatly bring this mood down
We are not New Yorkers, just work here and hang sometimes - but when we are out on the weekend, this is a great place to meet up with friends
Yes its crowded and expect to be here for over 1-2 hours so go if you have the time and indulge as the sushi/sashimi is 50% off
Where we live we dont have anything like this so its a great deal for us when we are in the area and have the time to enjoy
We have never had any bad deal - the sushi we have had is always very good - big platters dragon roll spider rolls all good
the hot sake is always a treat
We love it!
The place was alright!!! This place is always pack because of the 1/2 price
That's the only reason i eat here but when i really want fresh sushi i go to SUI down on Spring street
The service is very bad
Poor service
do not go there if you are in a rush
You can try to flag down the waitresses for more tea or the check all you want
They will ignore you, or nodd at you and then forget or do nothing
Absolutely ridiculous, frustrating service
Their food, however, is decent
and their prices hold me over on my sushi cravings
Half off sushi when you sit in
Not bad for the budget
Go expecting the slow service and sushi for very little money
i recommend their dragon roll
spend over $14 on sushi and get 50% off on your sushi bill
its not rocket science
five people, three huge platters of sashimi/sushi (includes misosalad), four large specialty rolls, two appitizers, one extra miso, and tea/coke
final bill $60
come with a larger group and they'll sit you in a more private back room
service was slow, but we weren't looking to be rushed
fish was fresh and delicious
no complaints
sushi is not fresh at all
service is extremely bad
they have a special where you get half off
dont be fooled
minimum you have to order is $14 so you end up paying $7
but just because i went with 7 people, the $14 suddenly became $25 and we ended up paying about $15 each for very bad sushi
also you cannot take the leftovers home
i do not understand this rule of theirs
With so many authentic and decent priced Japanese joints nearby (especially on St
Mark's) I don't know why so many people pack this place
This place is Korean-run
Not that this is a primary factor in rating a restaurant, but even though not all Japanese-owned Sushi places are good, I have yet been to a Korean-owned Sushi place that is good (Jeollado, Sandobe are all mediocre):  The sushi is bad
Unfresh
Full of mayo and things that overpower the fish
Tons of rice in rolls
Where the fish?  The service is horrendous
I have rarely seen so many waitresses work so inefficiently
I guess you do get what you pay for (They have a big 50% off sushi deal daily)
I think this really means that when you have a cafeteria, buffet-style environment, the quality of food like sushi really suffers
I keep going back for the 50% off sushi
Actually, I think it is the very best value sushi in NYC -- good quality sushi, for such a good price
Order the sushi/sashimi plates or the speciality rolls
Some reviewers get hung up on things like service
personally I really only go for the food and the price
If you feel the same way, then you'll love this place too
i went here on a whim and found out you could get sushi for half price kind of like happy hour
I was filled and the sushi was average
I would go again if I had to and only had $10
I've had take out from this place and it was so-so
When I tried getting a lunch order delivered, I was told I was out of the delivery range (strange since I am also located in the East Village)
When asked for their delivery range (14th to 1st, Ave
B to Broadway), I informed them I was within their delivery range upon which I was told that I was too far away
So
I won't be buying anything from this place again, and I'll be sure to let everyone I know not to do so, either

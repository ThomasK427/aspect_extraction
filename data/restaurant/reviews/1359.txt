My second choice - the braised short ribs - was tasty but way over cooked
Some parts were actually crispy! We skipped dessert
With so many other good reviews, I will give Melba's one more try
Hopefully the second time will be better
My boyfriend has been talking about Melbas since July
I arrived in New York City in September and we have been eating the delicious short ribs ever since, every other day
The staff and the lovely Melba is so understanding of my obession for the ribs, with the side order of collard greens
Oh my, food for comfort!
Great decor
A local place with downtown appeal
Melba's is welcoming
Try the short ribs and melba soul rolls
The collard greens taste like somebody's momma made them
i've been there four times and i can't get enough
The church pews are wonderful conversation pieces
however, I wish I could say that for the calamari
I know calamari and that is not calamari
All in all, Melba's is worth the trip uptown
Melba's does it the American way
with class! The menu includes something for everyone
My godson is an expert on mac-n-cheese
he give Melba's two thumbs up on the dish
My mother and I wenr to Melba's on my birthday and I was very pleased
The Sweet potato pie was excellent
There service was great, including Melba who is a kind hearted breath of fresh air
The space is a little small with a lot of tables, making moving in the restaurant a little hard but the decor is so great that the this issue is secondary
I hope we continue to see more wonderful places like this popping up in Harlem!
my wife and i was just walking around the hood and found this awsome seafood place
once you step in its
( W0W THIS PLACE LOOKS KOOL ! ) the staff there was really freindly the owner even sat down at one point to chat with us, it was hard to chose from the menu it all sounded good, so my wife and i shared plates to try a little of each dish , we ordered
lobster roll , sweet potatoe fries, steamers , scalops , and man that fish chowder was good , chilled wine , and we took our time so we could make room for panna cotta desert which i wanted seconds of yum !   oh yeah make sure you get to see the kool bathroom

This is the perfect spot for a quiet /romantic and RELAXING dinner
The waitstaff is friendly, the owners are great, and the entrees and desserts are perfection - kudos to the chefs! After my first visit to Tides, I knew I had found my spot for fresh fish of the day, steamers, fried clams and oysters and the awesome lobster rolls
Who needs to go anywhere else?
Went here on a Wed
evening
We had reservations, so I don't know what others are saying about them not taking reseravations! But the place was only about half full
The waitress was very nice, could have been a bit more attentive (checking up, asking if we needed anything else, etc) The wine was very good, the calamari was also very good, but the dipping sause they gave us was like a cup of lemon juice, much too sour! It def
brought down the taste of teh calamari
I had the snappr, which was pretty good, and my boyfriend had the salmon, which was great! Overall a nice experience, good food, and the ceiling is so cool - made of tiny bamboo sticks
THe place is very small though, so I can see how it might get crowded at times
I'd go back in an instant though
Really enjoyed our meal here, went for our 3rd anniv
and the place was great
Ambiance was very romantic, service was great
Had the Lobster Roll and Whole Fish, roll was great with a saffron and basil herb, soggy fries but the roll was great
The whole fish was a striped bass grilled with grilled veggies, everything was done perfectly, no special spices or seasoning, just simple fresh seafood
How can you go wrong?
i'm not a big seafood lover but i have been back to this litte cozy seafood joint time and time again
and eveytime i leave with a happy stomach
bamboo stick on the celling and interest restroom fixture keeps your eye wondering thru out dining there
The only thing i didnt like is the open kitchen, because it can get stuffy
but hey look on the bright side at least you know the kitchen is super clean
Good food
Nice Design
Highly Recommend
Would get there early to get seats
Very friendly service
I finally got the chance to visit Tides after trying several times to get in under the typical 45 minutes wait on the weekends
Instead I chose a week night, the wait was only 20 minutes
Design is an absolute knockout
Details included the 100,000 bamboo skewers in the ceiling, tables that flicker with a recessed candle and a unique bathroom
I had the seasonal lobster roll that incorporated taragon and cucumbers
Found it completely refreshing
Date had the bouillibasse which had a good mix of seafood in a fantastic broth
The perfect blend of spices and seasoning left me wanting more
When offered a taste, I nearly finished it all
Hot apple crisp with creme anglais for dessert was simply delectable
at first i thought it a tad sweet, but the cranberries that were incorporated gave it just enough tartness to compensate
Service was very friendly and pleasant
Yet another one of those eatery with catchy environment, need to fix the kitchen exhaust
An upscale restaurant will never let customer walk out smelling like they worked in the kitchen
Wine is not crisp cold, my cod fish is lukewarm and bland with the seasoned crust fell off, yea, the sweet-potato fries is VERY soggy
The chocolate cake is not even worth mention
For a restaurant with such limited menu and wine list, each dish should better be darn good
Never been in a seafood restaurant of such price range with such low quality food
Maybe the no reservation policy is just to gather a crowd outside the restaurant?
My girlfriend and I finally made it to Tides
We had heard only good things about this new place, and we were not disappointed! The space is beautiful, very zen and cozy
We had the bouillabaisse, which was incredible, and also the peppercorn tuna which was (quite peppery - duh!) and perfectly seared rare  over lentils and spinach
Both were superb
The owner suggested wines for us and offered us tastes of several varieties
We ordered glasses of the pinot noir, very light but with flavor that stood up to the bold dishes
Service was very good, and we were glad to find a new spot that serves up fantastic food in an elegant, yet casual and unpretentious atmosphere
Tides is absolutely one of the best restaurants in the city
The atmosphere, the quaint location, delicious food, and the fantastic interior design makes this place one of the best for years to come
The prices are pretty good for the quality of freshness of the foods
All the dishes were delicious from the oysters to the lobster rolls to the fishes
I recommend the lobster rolls for all the first time eaters
It was mouthwatering and to die for
I couldn't eat just one and the sweet potato fries on the side made the dish a perfect combination
The fried calamari and oysters were amazing as well as an appetizer
All in all, Tides is the perfect restaurant to take a date or spend it with family and friends
If you want quality food and friendliness in service, come to Tides!!!
Had high hopes, quickly dashed, though lovely little venue, beautifully designed by LTL architects
The food below average - overpriced and almost inedible
Pan seared cod fillet had batter (?) on it and tasted off, and the cracked peppercorn tuna was too peppery
Portions somewhat small, and 'sides' really lackluster (kale, a few random fingerling potatoes, lentils, etc
)

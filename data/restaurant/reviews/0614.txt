And was the farthest thing from friendly I have ever seen in a server
I thought her head was going to do a 360
If you are sensitive don't try this place!
Otto Enoteca and Pizzeria is fantastic
The food is unbelievable and the service is spectacular
One of the managers, Peter, was extremely accomodating and friendly and really enhanced our overall experience
You must try the Vongole pizza and the corn-pasta side-delicious!
it was so loud in otto that when we left we were still deaf
the food was nothing great--i'd rather have a slice on the street
the best part of the whole experience was the free breadsticks
What a wine list! LOVED everything
We went for lunch, so we missed the dinner crowds but our experience was well worth the 50
00 we spent
The pizzas are true to Italina art (not the American version of pizza)
Olives were to die for in their lemon infused olive oil
My margareta pizza was SO wonderful
Wine was great and the glasses are really more like 2 glasses (@ only 8$ a glass
who can pass that up!)
Service was great
Waitress was a little *preoccupied* but there were so many others filling water glasses, clearing plates, bringing dishes that it really didn't bother us too much
We are in NYC right : )
My wife and I recently had dinner here and really enjoyed it
Will definitely return: - long wine list with interesting and VERY reasonable selections - cheese plate came with delicious sauces (honey/truffle, cherry and peaches) which would have been better suited for dessert but delicious nonetheless
- we were seated immediately on a Thursday night (although holiday summer wknd may have helped) - incredibly nice and helpful wait staff - fruit infused grappa unlike anything I've had before - pizza and artichoke app also both delicious - gelato was also some of the best we've had in NYC  not your typical menu but thats what makes it great
For quality and NYC price wasn't too bad, $90 for two people incl
dessert, bottle of wine, apps entrees and after dinner drinks
but the rest is worth a visit
Absolutely delicious cheeses and meats, plus a wine selection to die for
We tried the anchovies, and eggplant caponata, too - all was great
Go with the idea of having a bunch of small tastes - it's not for those who would prefer your standard appetizer/entree/dessert structure
Great atmosphere, not too loud (maybe they read some of the previous posts here?)
Our waitress was very nice, not snotty - she even gave us a free apertif after the meal (and left the bottle on the table)
But definitely DON'T waste your appetite or money on that pizza
Yuck
Dry, too-thin crust - like a stale pita
I strongly disagree with critics of this restaurant
I think the people miss the point entirely
This is not supposed to be like your corner pizza parlor
This restaurant is for people who have a true taste and appreciation for authentic Italian style pizza, appetizers, and of course wine
The variety of the menu will satisfy any palate
The staff and sommelier are educated, extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with
The atmosphere is casual and relaxed
The potato, ricotta, and anchovy pizza is a hidden treasure on the menu
I've been a big fan of Mario before Otto
I have become a bigger fan after
I've been there twice already and will enjoy Otto many times to come
Critics should broaden their horizons experience something other than a mozzarella and tomato sauce pizza, and take advantage of what Otto's menu offers
Aside from the awful din - at the least, cut the music, please! - it's a lot like a wine bar in Venice
Don't go expecting the usual app
, main, dessert
Instead, roam the limited menu for tastes that appeal - for me, the pizza lardo (merely lightly-cured lard sliced wafer thin with lots of rosemary and salt
Absolutely great
) and the cheese plate (a generous 7 cheeses - all perfectly ripe)
This plate had some of the best accompaniments ever: cherries in brandy for the gorgonzola, etc
, funky black truffles in honey for the fresh ricotta (ethereal), and lightly candied fruits for the harder cheeses
Paired wines were decent, and the Bellini to start was good, and a bargain at $5 a glass
Fun place
I'll be back
pizza at OTTO is totally overated
As much as I love Mario for his passion and concept, the critics really love kissing this guy's !@*
It's as if he can do no wrong
amazing
But I love Mario
I've been to Lupa; the food is off-the-hook-good
I'm still saving my pennies for Babbo
But the pizza at OTTO really should NOT be the main attraction
My pizza with clams was dry, though the clams themselves were tasty
The antipasti (we tried the eggplant caponatina and the salsify with saba) were sublime
The 500+ wine list is superb
(You can find an excellent bottle for under $20!) The gelato is as good as it gets in NYC
Check out OTTO for the hip downtown atmosphere, the fabulous sides, tasting plates, and the awesome wine list
To my knowledge, you can't find a better enoteca for the money in the city
What part of Enoteca don't you understand? Excellent, very affordable wine list
The quartos are a great deal--I suppose some people confuse that with wines by the glass
The gelato is the best in New York (which isn't really saying that much--but it really is good here--get the olive oil)
There is nothing confusing about the menu to anyone with at least a kindergarten knowledge of Italian food
The pizzas are more authentic than the Brooklynites are used to--they're not great, but solid--get the lardo--that's the tastiest
But the appetizers (which are a great deal) is where the meal is made
However, I like to come here just for desert at 11:00 or so and have a quarto of Muller-Thurgau with some gelato--very satisfying
Oh, and this is a wine bar--leave the kids in New Jersey
UNBELEIVABLE!! SUPERB italian, from the wine straight through to the caramel brittle gelato sundae!! Totally authentic yet creatice
I discovered italian like never before and I AM italian!! The Bruschetta with Lilies (aka Leeks), and the pizza with tomato, pecorino and egg was unique and amazing
I would skip the veggie sides, they were too small to get a real taste, but definitely try the brushetta, pizza, salads etc
The clam pizza was also a little blad so ask them to spice it up and it'd be perfection!! Totally affordable and mario was there as well!!!
Only went for a late night gelato and a glass of wine, but the gelato was awesome! Oddly, I would highly recommend the olive oil gelato with strawberries
surprisingly good
Chocolate mint was also quite flavorful
It was late (10:30pm) so the crowds had abated, which was quite nice
I recommend it as a dessert destination!
just for the cheeses with truffle honey and the mind-blowing gelatos
they are unique and divine
My group agreed that Otto offers delicious morsels of food with an intense satisfying flavor
Prices were ridiculous, which we anticipated - 3 pieces of cheese @ $9
00 is laughable
But, the food IS worthy - the appetizers had us swooning savoring every bite
Try the phenomenal gelati
Service is brisk, professional  Complaints: talleggio pizza wafting thru the dining room was like a whiff of sweaty feet
The taste is a bit overwhelming too
And, Otto is SOOO stingy with bread!  C'mon! Bread is an Italian meal necessity for dipping, mopping wiping your plate clean!  In closing, it's sad when some CitySearch members have the need to allude to the opinions of others with condescending tones, childish remarks allusions to mental illness

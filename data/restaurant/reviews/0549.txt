Great for slices, especially the margherita
Cute atmosphere as well
Love Pizza 33
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing
their Pizza
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular
It hits the spot every time
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic
Everything a NY pizza joint should be
GO HERE
NOW
It's open late which is really great
It's a clean, place with great food
What esle can you ask for
?
This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice
Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone
The counter service is bad
They charge different prices all the time
They're rude at times, and not very friendly
NO PIZZA 33 for me!
cant get better late night pizza
a welcome addition to the murray hill area
Perfect in every way
The pizza is amazing and tastes like heaven
It is also not too greasy
The margherita pizza is great, and some prosciutto and it is excellent
Good for dinner and even better as a late night snack at 1am
The pizza here is, bar none, the best in New York
I LOVE this place, and make multiple pilgrimages a week for the excellent crust fabulous combination of cheese
All in a very low-key, fast efficient atmosphere
The java den
This comfortable coffee shop makes one feel at peace
The atmosphere takes you to that place, the place many dream of
Nirvana
The husband and wife team are what makes this coffee shop great
Now for the best part
The coffee
Whether your choose the iced blended mocha or the hot white mocha you are sure to be extremely happy
The java den serves the best coffee I have ever tested
Forget about Starbucks
Go to the Java Den, get a cup of coffee, a bagle or a pastry
Sit back in one of those comfortable chairs
Pick up a book or just sit back and have a conversation
You will be very happy with the experience
While there's a decent menu, it shouldn't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza
We ended up having to just leave because we were essentially being ignored by the wait staff--even though the rest of the restaurant was largely empty
Since the opening under new management I was excited to start eating there again
Before the service was so lousy the orders were constantly mixed up
But I was dissappointed yet again
I ordered something and they brought the wrong item and it took them over an hour and a half to replace it
Spotty service - took 20 minutes to get the order taken, even though we were the only people in the place who didn't have food and there were only a few other groups there
Then, after waiting more than 45 minutes for a desert pizza, we gave up and walked out
So much for some desert before the movie!
We went here looking for a decent italian meal
From the beginning we had decent service
I normally don't send back wine
The wine was horrible, but the waiter recommended something smoother and it was perfect
The fried calamari was good, however the sauce needs work
My black linguini w/ shrimp wasnt bad
Come here for an OK meal
My girlfriend and I came across this Italian restaurant thinking it would be a nice dining experience
We looked at the menu and the hostess came out to ask if we had been there before
I was there once before
She invited us to come there to dine and stated that she would provide us with a glass of wine on the house
We decided to eat there and she came over to tell us that she would take care of us after
This sounded ambiguous to me and I lated learned that this meant an after diiner drink called an apertif, not the wine she promised
When the check arrived I had to remind her of what she said about complimentary glasses of wine
I do not think it was fair of her to play a trick on an innocent couple
I met five of my friends for dinner at Blockheads last Friday night and had a good time
The host was incredibly accomodating and placed us in a corner table
The server was very understanding of my intoxicated friends' repetitive demands for more margaritas
The food was plentiful; as a proclaimed big eater, even I couldn't finish my plate
Overall, Blockheads is a decent choice if you're looking for a laid-back, friendly atmosphere
Unfortunately, they don't take reservations
so get ready to wait!
After we were seated, our waiter took my order and then my husband was about to speak to give him his order
He turned around and left while he was in the middle of ordering and left without taking my husband's order! It was only the two of us so it's not like he forgot to take an order in a huge group
We had to flag the manager down to give her our order again
No one came over to ask us if we needed anything else
Not even the manager
We handed our waiter our credit card and we waited 45 MINUTES for him to return with our card and he didn't
My husband had to go over to him tell him how long we waited and demand that he give us our bill so we could leave
No apology, not even eye contact
Just oh
One of my favorite places for Mexican food when I'm tight on cash
Excellent $3 frozen Margaritas, love the food
You won't wait to be seated, but you'll wait for your waitor
Service is slow and waitors can be a bit cold but it is still worth the trip!
their dinner specials are fantastic
for about eleven bucks you get a gigantic burrito (or tacos), margarita, and dessert
friendly staff
prompt service
perfect for a quick meal
Good reliable Mexican food
It tastes the way it should taste and great Good Burrito
The restaurant is very affordable as well
Best bbq beef sandwich on UE side

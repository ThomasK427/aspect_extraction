Candles flicker off sand-colored, cave-like walls under a retractable canvas ceiling
The laid-back Oz-accented staff answer "no problem" to just about everything
The Food The menu is more bistro than barbecue, but plenty of meat does get thrown on the barbie
A skewer of plump, nicely charred lamb cubes with polenta and green beans under a frizzle of fried onion stands up to the grill excellently, as do beefy slices of flatiron steak
Grilled-corn salad with grilled shrimp is worth ordering
The signature salad is lettuce piled with cubes of mango, avocado and spicy pecans
Pavlova, a national dessert down under, partners soft, chewy meringue with whipped cream, kiwi and mango, all topped with tart passion-fruit coulis
Whenever my friends and I got to the Cow, one thing is for sure -- we will be there all night long, and have a fantastic night of eating, drinking and partying
There have been times where we thought we would *start* at the Cow and go elsewhere
this has never happened
It is simply too fun to leave once we are at the Cow
I have had my bachelorette party there, too, as I married an Australian -- and the people at the Cow could not have been more accommodating
The drinks are great, the vibe rocks, and the food is delicious
And the staff is laidback, fun, and just plain awesome
One of the best places in the city to go for a casual night out
It's small but it's pretty cool
You've gotta check out the little outdoor-ish patio in the back too! Love the Aussies
Our first time to the Sunburnt Cow was less than stellar
We were a large party and it was a busy night
However, the owner called us and asked that we give them another chance
We understood that even the best places have off nights
It was highly commendable that the owner called us
Anyways, we went back and the food and service was superb
Favorite dishes were the shrimp and bessie (you have to read about it)
It lives up to all the rave reviews
I highly recommend it if you're looking for great food with a casual atmosphere
After lookin around for a place to have my 30th birthday, I decided on The Sunburnt Cow
I had been in for drinks before, gotta love the moo juice, and decided I would have dinner and stay and party
There were twelve of us and we got a 5 course family style tasting menu, we were so stuffed we didn't even want the dessert
Food was so good
Our waitress showed up twice with moo shots, so yummie
It was a friday night, the DJ was awesome and they had a digeridoo, who knows how to spell that, player, and a drummer
Was such an easy night
If you want to have fun, this is the place
I have been here a few times on a Saturday afternoon for brunch and I have to say it is great! Aside from the fact that you get unlimited drinks the food is awesome and the french fries are the best I've ever had
Both times I had the same two waiters and they are always pleasent and helpful
I got refill's on my drink without even having to ask
If your a brunch person you must check this place out
They keep refilling your glass-making it a great unlimited drinking brunch! (mimosas or foster's)
Sometimes there can be a wait
In a city filled with abundant restaurant choices, sometimes places become run of the mill, offering the same boring food choices and modern decor
The Sunburnt Cow is a happy departure from all that
The low priced Australian food is outstanding for your stomach and wallet
Things to try are Bessie Sandwich, the soups, and the sticky date pudding and pavlova are to die for
Staff is overtly friendly and un-New Yorkish
Overall, an interesting venture into different comfort food- a must try
We had dinner here, and they don't take reservations for groups under 6 so it was annoying waiting for a table for 40 minutes
But it got better soon after
The drinks were really good- albeit a bit weird served out of baby bottles
Once we were seated, we were right in front of the DJ booth and conversation became impossible
Also although dim lighting is always a plus- this place was too dark- we could barely see our food
Speaking of food, the food was amazing
I dream of their ribs
The staff was attentive and helpful in making suggestions
Their portions are tiny- so figure 2-3 per person
So much fun! Went on a Thursday night, sat outside - atmosphere was great, lots of people, great drinks
Went back on a Sunday and the place was pretty dead but I was with a group and there were drink specials, so it was nice having the patio all to ourselves
If you haven't been you should go, there are lots of other places nearby to check out as well
EAT CLUB REVIEW: The Sunburnt Cow 6/25/05
100% of those attending liked the food, delectable, distinct, and sublime, and best calamari in NYC with beautiful presentation
The service was friendly and exceptional and the atmosphere was also great
I have never been this close to a kangaroo before
A couple of us thought it was a bit on the pricey side, considering the location
One person noted, the DJ seems to tailor his music choices to the amount of grey in the customers' hair
Overall rating: very good
The only minus besides the price was a complaint about the lack of air conditioning early in the evening
(EAT CLUB is a loose association of New York City food lovers
)
This place was one of the few NY finds I've encountered
You get so much more than your money's worth on Sunday Brunch
For $15 you get unlimited mimosas or beer (we got bloody marys that were INCREDIBLE, like a meal in a drink, that they let us include in the brunch price), staff that is beyond friendly (this is the second time I was there and both times they came over with random drinks for us to try
Last time was Passion Fruit Infused Tequila), food that is amazing (I would have never put beets on a burger but it was INSANE), drinks that are unique (and don't cost your utility bill) and a pumping DJ that kept the place lively
A Must for anyone looking to gossip with their friends on Sundays after a crazy weekend!
The decor of the unique dining area reminds me of nowhere else in NY
I feel taken away every time I come to the Sunburnt Cow
The first time I came was on Valentines day with my girlfriend
We shared the couple's tasting menu, and were in love with the place ever since
We've gone out of our way to come back often as the food is consistantly better each time
On most nights the DJ spins funky music, while plate after plate of exotic food flows out of the kitchen
The Bessie Sticks are excelent, along with the Baramundi and the Boar
If you come with a big party, order one of everything and share, its all good
Also, you MUST try the Sunburnt - best drink on earth! Carefull though
the food might not be very expensive, but those drinks add up fast!
Best drinks, awesome crowd, amazing food, live music (sometimes) and a garden for the smokers like us! The friendliest bar in NYC hands down!!
What a find
This place has a funky outback rustic charm
Went a couple of nights ago and it has an austrailan tapas menu wich is perfect for this type of restaurant
Everything on the munu sounds interesting but mihgt not be the type of thing you would risk ordering your entire entree on
Kangaroo sausage ended up a little spicy for me but quite good
Lamb chop was out of this world the shrimp on the barbie was great and their barra fish was out of this world
Great date place and everthing on the menu is around $10 which is super cheap
On mondays they have there whole menu at $5 which is so cheap you might get arrested for stealing
Dont bother going in 2 mondays because I am going back with 12 people
:) Everyone is really nice there also
After hearing some positive word of mouth reviews about the restaurant/bar, six of us went down for dinner
Getting there was a little bit of a chore (not really near any subways), but the trip was well worth it
We went on a Monday night for their $5 food and drinks special
Everything was $5! All the food we ordered was great
The drinks were also great
It's not high caliber dining, but this place is obviously about more than just the food and drinks

not fast food in a traditional sense
All in all, this place tops my list for places to eat before a night out on the LES
I highly suggest checking out the truffle chicken salad that Zozo's serves up
Quite tasty in my opinion
Their buttermilk battered green beans are amazing and a nice addition to any dinner (a little more creative than just standard fries)
I also heard from one of the counter staff that they are starting delivery soon, so I plan on using this service often
My only complaint concerns the hours of operation
Zozo's seems to close at different times every time I go, so just be forewarned that they might stay open as late as 2:30 on some weekends, but not all of them
wow, what a find
This place has the best steak sandwiches in the city, there not like cheese steaks they are more like a real piece of meat that is grilled and then these great topping are added, the juices are kind of like papaya king but made to order with fresh fruit
I'm totaly going back soon
Great food to eat before you go out for a night on the town
What a delight to have a better place to eat than your typical sandwhich shop! The steak sandwhich was delicious and the best icecream I've ever had! I would highly recommend going to ZoZo's!!
This place opened a few weeks ago in my neighborhood
I was very excited for something new
The first time I went the service was a mess but the food was good
Since then I have gone a few more times and the service has gotten even worse some how, and the food has gone way down hill (and its way overpriced)
Do yourself a favor and go to one of the other sandwich/ice cream places in the neighborhood
They have the most amazing little fresh donuts
So good
And you can even get them on a Sundae with their homemade icecream
WOW
I had their buttermilk broccoli fries and their filet mignon steak sandwich and I was really amazed
I also had a bowl of their peanutbutter fluff ice cream and I practically licked the bowl clean
So good
I don't think it is fair to call this place fast food
Yes the food is quick service but their is NOTHING about this place that is in the vane of mcdonalds
The food is cooked fresh to corder and the decor is really nice, a funky loft like feel that makes you wanna hang out for a while
I really loved and recommend everyone check it out
This place serves everything I like to eat, Steak sandwiches, fresh fried vegatales and gelato
Cute staff behind the counter as well
Great place, sure beats the old deli around the corner
The food is so good, I ate there twice the first day I tried it! The steak sandwiches are the best I've ever had, as well as the grilled chicken, made from only the highest quality, juicy breasts
All ingredients used at Zozo's are top rate
Fresh juices give the place an island flavor
And everyone will love Kyria's ice cream- new versions of classic flavors
Boy, did this neck of the woods need this place! Welcome Zozo's!
Finally somewhere superb to eat on the Lower East Side day or night
The food is amazing the service is great and it's quick
Fast food doesn't have to mean junk food anymore
The steak and chicken sandwiches are the best I've ever had
Don't skip Kyria's ice cream
This is one of those rare finds
Don't miss it!
Great steak sandwiches in a neighborhood that desperatly need something to eat besides pizza and falafel
Also great doughnuts
teany to go is great when I don't have time to hang out in the cafe
I can grab a tea or coffee and a vegan scone or sandwich or vegan cheesecake on the go
Plus, I can call in when it's cold outside and they'll deliver! Since it's small it can get crowded but the punk- rock staff is always cool, polite and willing to help me choose from their huge tea menu :)
If you're looking for good wings, and want to try something a bit different - this little hole-in-the-wall place is fantastic! Amazing Japanese marinated wings - tangy and finger-lickin' good
The wings are best if eaten immediately at the small counter, but also good for delivery/take-out
The chicken skewers covered in panko crumbs are also good
A great hole in the wall with the real thing on the plate
Very friendly staff, good service and fantastic food
Portions can be large, don't over order, its hard not too
The Stuffed Grape Leaves an authentic delight is unsurpassed
Hot Hummus as Grandma made it
The Lamb Adana Kebab is drop dead
No need for desert
The wine list is meager but the unforgettable food makes up for anything missing
I've been here twice for brunch, and I found the ambience and food to be much better than the overly-hyped Kitchenette next door
I had a terrible dish at Kitchenette, but that's another story
I was pleased with my dishes both times, and the price wasn't bad
There are few good options in Morningside Heights, and this is one of the better choices
I got there and the only other group dining was the chef's friends, as the chef was sitting with them and they were yelling loudly in hebrew, bashing the group that had left
My party wasn't seated until we were found standing awkwardly
The water I got was cloudy (they said that only bottled h20 is clear), getting a pita is 75cents extra apiece, and the manager kept screaming in the kitchen w/open doors
The hummus tasted burnt - like a cigarette was thrown in the mix
My Challah French Toast was burnt on the bottom and they looked at me like I was mad because I asked for it to be redone
My companion's Siniya which was undercooked
Considering the prices, the food portions are really small and leave something to be desired
On top of that, half the menu was unavailable
My sunday brunch was just disastrous
Avoid this place
The portions are tiny, the prices are way too high for what you get, and the food is terrible
On top of it all, the staff are rude and unfriendly
Don't waste your time on this place
The Scene Song, the Thai word for "two," is Park Slope's sequel to Joya, a perpetually packed Thai spot in Carroll Gardens
The sister restaurants share identical menus and bear a striking family resemblance
Here, the slim bar area opens up to a spacious, streamlined, and bustling dining room
Industrial gray dominates the color scheme, but soft lighting warms the space and eclectic dance music (spun by a DJ on weekends) lifts the mood
The Food Inexpensive, large-portioned, Americanized Thai favorites are served up at lightning speed
A hearty helping of marinated beef tops a bed of lettuce, cilantro enhances a mild mango salad, and zesty sauce complements lightly battered calamari
The spicy broad noodles and green curry pack a punch and can be made spicier upon request, while copious bowls of pad thai and chicken in garlic sauce soothe more delicate palates
Desserts aren't offered, but the mango martini makes a sweet finale
This place is great, modern decor, and cheap thai dishes
there is a large selection and its all really good
Their curries are awesome
The only drawback is long waits on the weekends, and its REALLY LOUD in the restaurant, if youre in a large group, you wont be able to hear the person next to you, much less the person across from you
Its not romantic, but its pretty trendy
KIDS THIS IS THE SPOT
IT IS VERY INTERESTING LOOKING AND HAS GREAT FOOD
IT IS EASY TO GET TO FROM MANHATTAN AND GIVES OTHER THAI RESTAURANTS A KICK IN THE BACKSIDE ON ITS PORTIONS
Some people are a fan of the ambience but I'm not really one of them
I want to be able to talk to the person I'm eating with and the music is just a couple of notches too loud
That being said I've been multiple times and I'll go again
The food is good and the portions are huge which keeps me coming back
Also interesting specials
My water was filled like eight times, good, fast service
Song has it all - fabulous atmosphere, excellent Thai, creative potent drinks and music to boot - all amazingly priced

nice place for a date
This is my favorite restaurant in the city! They make you feel like it's your place by always greeting you at door (which is nice when I bring in clients and friends), and the food is inexpensive and delicious
My favorite dish is the pappardelle with lobster, but the steak and poached salmon are also really good
One of the best things about this place are the appetizers, since they have so many unique things to choose from (I always get the clams and the zucchini!) and they're all like $7 or $8 each
Definitely a find
Although the waitstaff surpassed expectations and the decor is minimalist chic, the food is a complete turnoff
The homemade pasta was straight from the Barilla box
When sent back, the entree was replaced by a good seafood salad and was comped
A very apologetic maitre d' was very gracious
I would go back, but just for the drinks, atmosphere, and people
I took my wife there this evening after reading all the wonderful reviews and I must say that this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had anywhere
The food is above average but it tastes even better due to the genually nice, attentive service
Please visit, as this is exactly the type of restaurant that needs to flourish
I will recommend this restaurant to everybody
came here after reading all the reviews, the place is small sexy and beautiful
it was nice to get away from the village and soho, and come here, the place is classy yet relaxing, i love the lighting and the candles, THE WINE is amazing
i loved it
the food is okay nothing spectaculor but it is good, and great portions, and even better prices
i like the bartender she is very attentive practically runs the whole show
well its on my top five so clearly i will go back again and again
Pretty decent place for midtown east location
Food is good, service is great
Portions were not that big
Liked the atmosphere
I highly recommend! My favorite neighborhood place - a hip downtown feel with good music (some Italian pop!), even though it's in midtown
The food is great, and really well-priced, which is one of the reasons I keep going back -- try the tasting dishes with the mussels, baked clams, or scallops (amazing!)
The service is excellent: not too in-your-face, but very attentive, and the sangrias and fragolinas are to die for
:)
OK, I've been in New York City for 9 years, and been to many many restaurants
But this place has nothing special than any other so so neighborhood restaurants
Food was OK, nothing extraordinary, service was OK and ambiance was OK
It was dark and small, filled with business people and old people
You can try once if you want, but I think that will be it
I wouldn't go there ever again
Went to a wine tasting at this midtown restaraunt/bar yesterday, and was extremely pleased with this place
I've read the other reviews here and they all seem positive, and I see why
There is a downtown feel to the place, although it's set in Midtown
The drinks are reasonable priced, they hire hot bartenders which is always a plus!   There's an extremely warm atmosphere from the second you step in the door
The wine we had at the event was excellent, and we liked this spot so much that we ended up forgetting the time and had to cancel the reservations we had at a restaraunt downtown
No worries, we were promptly seated and had an amazing meal
This will become a regular spot for my gang, have a feeling we'll be back really soon
Although this place specializes in bar scene I took my family of 11 people ranging f/14 years to 60 here ealy evening ,prior to a show
I found the food and service to be superb
One of the most enthusiastic and attentive staff i've encounterd in Manhatten
A great time for all, I shall return!!!!!! highly recommended
This is a great place to come after work with friends for drinks and appetizers
Once you stop in though you will be tempted to stay for dinner
The food is always so fresh and never disappoints
Their chopped salad is seriously the best I've ever had
I highly recommend bar
vetro!
I've been to Vetro a few times and it just keeps on getting better
The service is warm and friendly (unlike most midtown places)
The food is not only amazing, but reasonably priced as well
A new favorite for midtown dining
I have been here for lunch about four times, food is fabulous and the staff very attentive
Highly recommend it
I first visited bar vetro a few months ago and was plesantly surprised with the atmosphere
the bar and lounge is a bit small but not at all cramped
the feel is very sleek and cozy, and the glass bar itself is the highlight of the decor
good loungy music too
all this while sipping great martinis or one of many wine selections available by the glass
if you like apple martinis try the ones they make
I brought my girlfriend to Bar
Vetro for Valentine's Day (2004)
They had a 4-course pre-fixe dinner with a optional wine tasting
The food was pretty good
I wouldn't say it was the best italian food I ever had but it was pretty good
The waiter was very nice and personable
Decor/ambience was romantic, yet very modern
The best part of the meal was the dessert
It was probably the best chocolate cake (served with coconut ice cream) I ever had
Overall, I highly recommend Bar Vetro for a date
Really good appetizers and a lot of selections for the main course
I've gone here with a bunch of my friends several times and I always have a good time -- the ambiance is pretty different from the other restaurants in the area, which I like
It's romantic, but sort of modern at the same time
I recommend!
I went to Bar Vetro with a group of friends after work This place turned out to be a great place to go for drinks
The bar area is spacious with bar seating as well as a lounge table area
We ended up staying for dinner and the food is excellent
nothing bad to say here
The atmosphere, food, and service were all great
Service is definitely part of the experience in any restaurant, and I found the service to be exceptional at this New Spot in Midtown
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the host, which in itself sets this place apart from some of the restaurants in New York
We were then treated to incredible service by a cheery and pleasant waiter
The food was fabulous, from the Endive Salad to the Grilled Lamb Chops
I highly recommend this place to those of you looking for drinks at their nice glass bar or for a superb meal
I ate at Bar Vetro soon after it's reopening (it used to be Anche Vivolo)
We were seated promptly and had very attentive service
Our waiter recommended thZt we share a few of the appetizers; they were great
It had the same quality of food I've enjoyed at the other Vivolo's restaurants and a hip, young new look
Highly recommended
bar
vetro is excellent
the atmosphere is chic, the food is amazing, and the staff is delightful
i would recommend it to anyone for a meal, or just for drinks
bravo!
Disappointing overall
Atmosphere, by far the establishment's greatest asset, was only decent
Staff was unfriendly

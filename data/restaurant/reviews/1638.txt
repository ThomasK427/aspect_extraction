The food and service are superb
This small restaurant is packed with red christmas lights, it adds a fun and interesting appeal
During the weekend it's packed but the food still comes super fast
And the price is very cheap
They are the best!
Mmmmmm
Cheap indian food under the gentle light of one thousand X-mas lights
Delicious foods, in small portions make for great sharing, and an even better check
I would recommend the chicken with bananas dish, it was great
For their prices the food is unbeatable
The portion size is modest (what a human being should eat) and the service (once you're seated) is efficient, although when you arrive you will most likey have to wait outside for a table to become available (the place is too tiny to wait inside), but at least they give you a little something to nibble on while while you wait
It's a wonderful, out of the ordinary night out with friends!!
Go there for birthdays
It's quite an experience and the food's cheap, and you get good portions
I don't recommend going here with a headache or hangover, though
This is one of the most cramped restaurants I've been to, but worth it
After getting past the other restaurants (and being heckled - but hey it's part of the atmosphere) we finally got up upstairs in the very lighted, fun place
The food is good (taste wise) for the amount of money you pay
Portions are just right and you get a great deal if you order any of the specials
The place is a little cramped and lights are EVERYWHERE so beware you tall people
Regardless I had a fun and cheap dinner averaging about $12
Not bad right?
I've been going to Panna II for the past 4 years
You can eat until you're stuffed there and the bill doesn't usually go over $20 for two people
Sure the atmosphere is a bit cramped (be prepared to bump elbows with everyone!), but the service is attentive and pleasant and the food is delicious! On weekend evenings there is usually a line of people outside, so either get there early or be prepared to wait for a table
we've been going to this glorious place for around ten years - the number and arrangement of lights has altered now and again but the food, value and overall greatness has not
with one exception, they no longer thank you when they hand you a menu
IF YOU'RE ONLY UP FOR SPENDING ABOUT $5 AN ENTREE AND STILL WANT GOOD INDIAN FOOD THEN THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE! IT'S NOT THE BEST INDIAN YOU CAN FIND BUT IT IS PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE ARE INCREDIBLY NICE!
With enough christmas lights to challenge any oversized christmas tree, or winter suburban home for that matter, this restaurant ranks as one of my favorites for the ambience alone
Add bhangra playing in the background, a busy atmosphere, a decent menu and great prices, this will soon become your favorite as it has mine
Having visited over the past few years enough to have a number of less than ideal experiences, I recommend this place for small parties looking for good food, cheap prices, a short casual dinner, and a crazy atmosphere you can tell all your friends about--before bringing them yourself the following week!
I had a decent meal here a year or two ago
But I just had the worst meal I ever had (for the money)
Not only were the mussels cold and congealed, but the veal scaloppine with roasted potatoes were similarly cold and flavorless
The textures were so disgusting I could not even come close to finishing my entree
It was quite clear that they did not even bother to season the veal with salt and pepper before they threw it into the saute pan
No lemon squeeze, no parsley either
They piled it high with some unidentifiable onion muck and not-even-half-toasted pine nuts
Even though I was ravenous, it stopped my appetitite cold
GAAK
Props for the Pinot Grigot house wine, for which they charged me a whopping $9, but I have to say this place is a waste of fine real estate
Worst $41
50 I ever spent
PTUI
I think this place is great
A friend and I recently had dinner there and enjoyed it very much
The bruchetta is excellent, as were the meals and the wine
I'm going back again tonight!
The prices are as fair as the food
Moderately priced for moderate Italian cuisine
Nothing special about the atmosphere
Even the outdoor setting is as plain as the dishes they serve
For an inexpensive outdoor lunch during the spring and summer months it's okay
But for an intimate dinner with a friend, you may want to keep walking downtown
I made this my dinner stop last night, after visiting the C-Note
Athough the waiter was initially attentive to my order, he didn't stop by to see if I wanted anything else, or to find out if everything was okay
I ordered the the ribbon pasta with tomato sauce and bacon
The pasta was good (al dente), but the sauce was unexceptional and the bacon was fatty, so I didn't eat it
When I was finished, I saw that the bacon took up half of the pasta plate
Although I won't eat here again, I can say that the most pleasant part of the meal was sitting outside, enjoying the late summer evening, and overhearing an interesting conversation at the next table
I wonder what the hell you all experienced there? Went there Weds night and clearly didn't see what everyone else did (save the delightful un-punctuated review)
4 of us shared apps, entrees, dessert drinks
The bruschetta exc, salad fresh, entrees had tasty vegetables, pasta sauces flavorful, chocalate fondue w/ fruit yummy, etc
The *only* negative is we got our bread oil (yes, yes, a bit bland) AFTER the entree
Our waiter likely forgot it was so busy
It came then b/c a busboy heard us mention, no bread at an Italian rest
?! The $100 check for that much food was quite reasonable anywhere in the village, even if it was sub-par (and it wasn't)
I didn't notice the service, meaning it wasn't overly attentive nor lacking
Our time there was really positive
What's different from yours, I don't know
Has everyone gone there on a Saturday night?
Not bad for what it is but that's not saying much
As one reader eruditely pointed out, it's the place where other people go who can't get in somewhere else
We didn't feel like waiting an hour across the street so we chose In Padella because there was no one there
Obviously, that speaks volumes in NYC on a saturday night
To start, no plates for the bread or to pour the olive oil (tasteless)
Vine was about 10 degrees above room temp (blasphemy)
Veal Parmisano was burnt as were the potatoes (I could do that at home)
Service was mediocre
On the positive side, you can sit outside easily and let the passers-by keep you distracted from your plate
In conclusion, if you go on a date here, don't expect another
If you go with friends, enjoy the company because the food will leave much to be desired
Stay away from this one
Number one, this place really just has a bad atmosphere - filled with people who couldn't get into any of the other places in the area that are worth mentioning
Number two, this dive supports some of the angriest, irrate wait staff in the city
Number three, the food is just plain bad
On another note - Dear Citysearch, please do not allow people to write reviews if they cannot spell and/or grasp the english language

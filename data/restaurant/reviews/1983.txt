Great food
It's open late and is fun for double dates
The waiters are kind, funny, and help you for the best dishes if you are picky
Family style is very Italian and it's a fun night out
Especially if not italian
This is not a top notch restaurant with out of work models and actresses
It's a place where a person goes to eat and talk to your close friends and family
It's fun
like a theme bar
but the food is great and you get plenty of it
Remember all the brooklyn mafia movies you watch , this is the type of cooking there grandmother did on Sunday's
Do you think they chose what was put on the table
neither do you :)  Trust me
this is the real Brooklyn italian family expirience  P
S
They do have a menu
You just have to ask for it!!!!
seated promptly and began feasting immediately
not having a menu was rather strange at first but the food was superb
the decor basically is lawn tables and pictures of customers all over the walls - so it's nothing spectacular, but the service is good and the food is excellent
La Mela has amazing Italian food, as expected from its Mulberry Street location
I went here during the San Gennero festival and was, to my surprise, seated right away
All of the food was great, starting from the tomato and mozzarella appetizer, to the pasta with seafood entree
I even saw Steve Schirippa from the Sopranos eating there
I would definitely go back
This cozy lil joint on Mulberry really blew my friends and I away with the friendly and attentive help, and the onslaught of flavor and variety with the menuless cuisine
great for the person on the run, just sit down and you can start eating!
Last night (thursday), under a snowy weather, this was one of the very few restaurants in the area to be open late
We had great food  (fish appetizer and pasta), service was very kind, and people being there  that late looked like a really good crowd
The food was good, the service uneasily fast, but myself and part of my group felt like cattle, hearded in and set down infront of our grain and then rushed out
First of all our reservations were lost, but they did our best to accomidate us when we all arrived, so that was great but the space we were put in was well
lets just say 22 people don't fit at a long table made for about 15 at the most
Like I said great food but I particularly don't like being rushed
I was in Italy this past summer and there is no other place in New York to feel the Italian experience other than La Mela
The waiters are outstanding and the food is excellent
I love the idea of having a bottle of wine at the table for you to pour whenever you want! And it is totally worth the money
inexpensive according to NY standards
Definitely recommend it!
Pepino and the boys are cooking up something good! La Mela is the best kept secret in Little Italy
The secrecy lies in the fact that the place has grimy floors, flourecent lighting, a thousand pictures of Vinny and Paulie livin it up on the walls, and a catchy pull toy in the main room
But settle into one of the plastic chairs and buckle your eating belt
There's no menu here, so let the waiter wow you with hot anipasti, pasta and veal! I have been going here since it opened in 1985 and family style Southern Italian food cannot be done better
I think la mela is the best
I can't wait to get back to New York to go again
awesome food and a lot of it
Pace yourself so you can try it all
It is tempting to eat every thing on the plates every course because it is so good and keeps getting better every dish after
this place is great
i have been living in london for the past six months and seriously i get the most homesick when i think about La Mela
i have been going for about 8 years
Dont order a thing just let them take care of you
Go w/ a bunch of friends and go hungary
REAL HUNGARY
it can get crowded sometimes but its more than worth waiting for
every time we go everybody stumbles out of there drunk, full and as satisfied as can be
If i knew i were going to die tomorrow id be on a plane and eat at la mela tonight
It is small and not much to look at so dont be a snob about it
just enjoy it
say hi to pepe(aka father time if you see him) he's a real sweet man
Have a great time!!!!!!!!!!
i love this place
i eat here everytime i come to ny
the food is great
i love the apps and the pasta
i can not understand how anyone can say that the food is bad here
i have had nothing but good experiences every time i have gone
i feel the price is pretty reasonable
i must say that i have never made it past the pasta!! too much food!! i love italian food and this is IT!!!! nothing compares!!!the people that are bad-mouthing La Mela must think they are too good for this enjoyable family stlye place
the food is EXCELLENT!!!
you dont know what you are missing!!!!
I went here on a whim the first time with 3 friends
We didn't order-the waiter just kept piling the food in front of us
We drank ate and were very merry! The atmosphere is very relaxed and the waiters can be a lot of fun
Went back 3x afterwards and had the same great food
Next time, the waiters were down right rude and the food was ok (I did order off the menu
) Figured I'd give it one more try and have been going back ever since
I reccomend it to all my friends and no one has ever been dissapointed
I do reccomend not ordering off the menu
if you don't eat it or want it, just tell them you want something else or more of what you liked
This is a great place to go with a large group of people
There is so many things that can be ordered and brought out deliciously to your table
this is the only restaurant I go to when I am Little Italy
4 of us recently ate here and quite frankly all of us were unimpressed
Basically it was like eating at a buffet bar but having the food served to you
You don't order, courses are brought out to you, whether you like them or not (and the same goes for the wine)
The food was just O
K
, nothing to write home about
I would say younger, less deserning, indviduals would go for a place like this, because they can drink as much as they want and not worry about the quality of the food
I have been going to La Mela forever
I love this place and would go back anytime
I have been to Italy several times and they get pretty close to the real thing!! Multo Benne!!
The best food on the planet, wiht enormous portions and a fun atmosphere
More food than you could possibly devour - remember to pace yourself by course! Beginning with fresh mozzarella with olive oil and tomatoes ending with cannolis and chocolate covered neopolitan this place rocks!!
We would eat here every week if we lived in NY
To bad we're in Louisiana and can't get there! This was by far the best food that we ate in NY while we were there
I would highly recommend it to everybody who visits NY
I've been there twice, both times with people visiting the city (once with Italian restaurant owners)
Everyone has loved it! Definitely a differnt dining experience, but fun and the food is always delicious
This is the kind of place that is suppose to have pushy waiters and a loud atmosphere

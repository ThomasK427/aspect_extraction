You will not be disappointed! For what you get, it's very reasonably priced (we paid $100+tip for omakase sake) Reservations are highly recommended, so don't expect to be able to walk in a sit down right away (with reservation, you get seated exactly on time)
It is a little cramped, but we don't go there for fancy ambience -- we go for amazing sushi!!
Any sushi expert knows that Sushi of Gari has the best sushi in all of Manhattan
This place is on par with Gari
From the scallop to the fried oyster to that oh so melt-in-your-mouth toro, bar-none, this place wins hands down
Get the chef's omakese and you will not be disappointed
The service was excellent, attentive, and fast
In fact, our waitress overheard us talking about my upcoming birthday and mistook the evening for a birthday celebration and wound up bringing us a birthday desert
We will definitely come back again!
I have been to Sushi Seki for the past 12 months and it is still one of the best place for great sushi - both in value for money and quality
Yeah sure you need to book but as a regular customer I appreciate that for those who book do get their seat (contrary to the previous ignorant reviewer)
If people who pop in on the off chance I recommend they come back later when there is no clash with previous bookings - its definately worth the wait
The decor has improved over the year but believe me with the great ingenious starters and melt in the mouth tuna - its certainly a mmmmmmm and closing of the eyes moment
Who's looking at the decor - not me
It's an orgasmic moment (second to my hubbie!)
Enjoy you sushi lovers
We tried Sushi Seki after hearing a rumor that it was opened by a deciple of Sushi of Gari (one of our favorite sushi restaurants)
Not sure if that is true, but Sushi Seki is excellent and very similar to Gari - especially the Spicy Tuna
The eggplant miso appetizer is my favorite
We know go there at least twice a month
The restaurant is a bizarre shape which detracts from the atmosphere, but the sushi is fresh and totally worth it
Nondescript place, but truly great sushi
Definitely best in the neighborhood
Get the chef special plate - amazing!
Ate there a month ago and was pleasantly suprised - it's suprisingly good - I'd say a notch below Nobu/Blue Ribbon but fairly close and much less expensive
Decor isn't the greatest but it works
although it looks like any other japanese restaurant, real foodies know that this is one of the best places for sushi
sit at the sushi bar - the chefs are friendly and accommodating
it's worth the trip if going to the upper east side seems out of the way
i did it and will happily do it again
Great soba noodle dishes in a very pleasant, relaxed environment
The cold soba noodle and beef salad is really delicious
I had another nice meal at Soba Nippon last night
Traditional Japanese dishes, such as Katsu-don (Pork cutlet egg over rice) and Kimpira (sauteed vegetable), were cooked perfectly as always
Needless to say their soba is definitely one of the best in New York
Yet, the place was emptyIts too bad because the food is authentic and price is very reasonable considering the location and the quality (eg
Appetizer starts from mere $4, and my favorite Beef Salad, which uses sliced prime rib cooked in shabu-shabu style served with ponzu sauce, is only $10
) Maybe it's the name, maybe the decor
unlike its sister Restaurant Nippon, the interior doesn't give you the exotic feel, but looks more like fusion restaurant
If you dont know very much about Japanese food, its a good place to start, before going to those nouvelle japonaise establishments
The chicken soba salad is not to be missed!!! fresh chicken over crisp lettuce and hommade soba noodles all tossed with a wonderful dressing makes this the best salad in the city
believe me- run- don't walk- to get one!!!!
I found this place to be one of my favorite weekly restaurants to eat at
Being that I am there so often, I have had the oppurtunity to try practically the whole menu, and everything that I have tried has been excellent
The service is above average and the food is quickly brought out to you
The manager is quite friendly
All in all this is one of the best places I have eatten in awhile
the atmosphere is very nice, and a welcome escape from the rest of the SI mall
However, the food and service and dramatically lacking
The sushi is cut in blocks bigger than my cell phone
We requested they re-slice the sushi, and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes
The wait staff was loud and inconsiderate
While moving tables together nearby, instead of actually lifting the tables to place them together (the tables are not too heavy), the staff dragged the tables across the floor making a terrible and load skreeching noise that was heard throughout the dining room
Do NOT recommend
I've taken out and eatin in
I have to say the food comes fast, never a mistake with the order, and my wallet thanks me when slips into a food coma
I recently went there with my friends to watch the game and was all over their southern style BBQ ribs
I love the food and the atmosphere
I've been there for more than 4 times already
The ribs and the cheese burger were fabulous
The server is friendly
I definitely will come back
They have the right idea with the menu, but somewhere between the menu and having the food delivered to our table, something went horribly wrong
Ribs were bbq-soaked gristle on the bone - and cold - about 20% edible meat
I understand I wasn't at a French bistro, but Steak Frites left something to be desired and it certainly wasn't the after-taste
Vegetable of the day - peas and carrots may have well as been freezer burned rejects from Fairway's frozen foods section
Cornbread must have been from yesterday
We won't be back
I actually only had food from Home delivered -- but did so twice and it was excellent both times
The french fries -- with the kalmata dip were terrific! Highly recommended
As stated, I haven't dined *in* the restaurant but stopped by there to pick up takeout and it seems a very relaxing place; also, the bar looks nice
We have liked it both times
We havent had the food delivered yet, but we ate there twice
Very good food, simple and tasty
Servers were nice, and theres no pretense in the place
Perfect to stop by and have a quick meal on the way home from work on the weeknights
The mashed potatoes and the steak were very good
We'll be back
The Scene In a neighborhood where cheap, chic Italian joints are a dime a dozen, this cozy, low-lit osteria looks the part--and exceeds expectations
The young Modenese owners fuel a fun mood with their inventive, nibble-friendly menu, which casual crowds relish at rustic banquettes and high bar tables alongside retractable floor-to-ceiling windows
Service is efficient and attitude-free
The Food The quality is high and the Italian cooking is thoughtful, rendering the simplest dishes--like lightly fried, milky-fresh mozzarella or velvety fennel soup--surprisingly elegant
Affordable starters comprise most of the menu: Cheese plates with sweet-sour chutneys, spicy lamb-stuffed fried olives and plump mussels baked under saffron-herb breadcrumbs are addictive, but signature tigelle panini fixings shouldn't be missed
Creative homemade pastas, like spongy maltagliati with gamy lamb-rosemary ragu, and shrimp-stuffed crepes, are far above average
Herb-roasted chicken breasts and mixed fried fish are cooked just right, and best followed by molten chocolate 'sformatino
Last night was the fourth time I've eaten at Perbacco and I've loved it every time
Authentic, unusual Italian fare in a casual setting at reasonable prices
Outdoor seating on quiet 4th St is a big plus, too
Wait for your table at the bar nibbling on delicious focaccia croutons and sampling wines
One of my favorite Italians in the city, no doubt about it
I have sent several friends and family to Perbacco and everyone comes back raving about their experience
Lots of small plates to choose from
The unfortnuate thing is no reservations
Be sure to go early in the week
What a great find! Went with some friends and we had such a great time
Love all the small dishes for sharing
The fried olives and rice balls are great! As was everything else on the menu
In a bind for somewhere to go last night, we decided to go back and were just as pleased the second time around
I've eaten in this restaurant on several occasions and was satisfied
I asked for a glass of wine, he brought a bottle and poured a taste

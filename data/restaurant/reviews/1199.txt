The chef does an amazing job of recreating the food of Tuscany and Firenze
Like all the postings state, it brought us right back to Italy: the aromas, the setting and the service
The menu is very similar to any osteria across the ocean
The style also fitting
The crostini took me right back to the casalinga places altrarno
The homemade pastas were killer - even the ones not stated as homemade were terrific
The wine list was pretty complete and priced typical for NYC restaurants (not Italy)
We will be bringing our friends and family back and back until we taste the entire menu
Thanks for coming to Park Slope
Andiamo!
Wow! I randomly walked into this place last week for lunch and had no idea how good it would be
So it's a $10 set price-- I got a nutty pumkin soup to start, a panini that had suckling pig and arugula on homemade focaccia and ended with coffee and almond biscotti
Damn
That's all I can say
The food was out of this world
Not to mention how cool the vibe is with its fireplace going, great architecture and design, true sense of Italy
Lots of mothers and babies in strollers seem to have discovered this place but I would recommend it to all
Slightly costly if you don't get in on the prix fixe brunch or early dinner menus
The food was very good although the servings were on the small side
The breast of duck special one night was delicious
The pastas were good but not special
The house red was excellent for carafe wine
Service was good but we , a party of 4, had to wait a long time to be seated
The noise level was not bad for a very crowded restaurant
Suggest reservations for weekends
The front of the restaurant is none too roomy but there might be space for larger groups in rear
I ate at Scottadito last Friday night with my boyfriend and the food was so amazing
It was so authentic, it was just like being in Tuscany
I had the ricotta and spinach gnochhi's they were so good and not too heavy, but full of flavor
My boyfriend had the wild boar ragout with homemade egg pasta, it was also superb!!!!  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes real tuscan food
hands down the best italian in PARK SLOPE!!! Looking forward to going back soon
Also, our server Sonny was the best
so helpful and really knew her stuff!!!
This is the sweetest little restaurant I've found in Brooklyn
I am Italian, so you know the food must be good! Every time I've eaten here, I feel right at home
There are always family members mingling about (true to Italian restaurants in Italy)
The atmosphere is delightful, complete with a fireplace, back sunroom, and outside seating
From the brick interior and the wood detail, to the cellar wine bar, and luxury changing table in the bathroom - they have thought of everything in the design of this place
Perfect for a date or brunch (Weekends are prix fixe $12 and include endless mimosas or juice
) Oh right, the FOOD ~ words cannot describe how delicious, perfectly cooked, fresh and beautifully presented the food is here
MANGIA!!
My girlfriend and I have stopped in twice here for weekend prix-fixe ($12 w/unlimited champagne or mimosas!) brunch
Great selection of both traditional breakfast items Italian dishes
Highlights have included amazing pan dulce w/fresh fruit and homemade porcini ravioli in a lucious white wine/cream sauce
Everything seems to be made with much care wherever possible, all ingredients are organic
Service both times was very attentive welcoming
Only downside is that w/the champagne flowing, you can easily loose track of time and blow a big hole in whatever plans you may have had for the day (oh well
)
This place is so much more worthy than the terrible 5
3 rating is has received
Who can complain about organic food, home made bread and pasta, and unlimited mimosas or champagne with brunch for only $12?!! I have been here twice for brunch and the service and food have been consistent
The staff are friendly and accomodating and keep refilling your glass with morning cocktails!  The ravioli is excellent, as are the frittatas
The french toast is unbelievable--it is soaked in batter the night before and melts in your mouth
The atmosphere is relaxing and quite lovely--sit in the back room if you can where the bamboo garden is
And if you shop at the food co-op next door, make sure you get a good buzz on before heading over there--it makes the co-op experience that much more interesting!
I have been to Scottadito several times, and the experience always surpasses expectations
The pasta is the freshest around, the olive oil peppery and lush, the ambiance comfortable, and the service gracious
To top it off, the prices are much less than one would expect for the quality
A neighborhood gem
Wow
my boyfriend and I had a great night at Scottadito
What a wonderful welcome to this up and coming part of Park Slope
The service was friendly and helpful on what to order
We will be back soon
I've been eyeing this place since its opening
candle lights and a fireplace warm up this rustic country style restaurant on Union
I had high hopes but was surprised the food was beyond my imagination
We had the specials (I usually shy from specials as my belief is if its good enough it would stay on the menu) Porcinni and Truffle Risotto and the crawfish w/homemade pasta with a light tomato sauce
They were both outstanding
and the dessert they recommended was a sweet'ntart mousse with fresh strawberries
nothing like I've ever tasted in my life
we shared but fought til the last spoonful
it was a memorable and exciting dining experience!
AMAZING food--the octopus salad was out of this world, and the gnocchi was to DIE for--absolutely melted in my mouth! Great wine list, warm and wonderful atmosphere--romantic enough for a date, yet casual enough for your family
Great, friendly and knowledgeable staff
A tremendous asset to Park Slope - I keep going back!
I came into Scottadito with my boyfriend and we had a romantic dinner on a snowy night in front of their fireplace
Having lived and studied in Italy, my first and lasting impression was the authenticity
I was filled with nostalgia when I walked in and saw the natural wood tables, heard the sentimental Italian music, and was greeted by the manager with Ciao bella-- I felt like I was back in Florence again
The waitress came to our table and told us about their tempting specials
We first shared a spinach flan and then I had the Venison Osso Buco-- amazing-- and my boyfriend had the Wild Boar Pappardelle-- definately competed with what I ate in Tuscany
We finished the night off with espresso and homade gelato
If you need to get away to Italy, but can't afford the time or money, go to Scottadito
I highly recommmend it
My girlfriend and I recently traveled to Tuscany; stepping into Scottadito brought it all back
In the light of the fireplace, exposed brick walls and chunky wooden tables evoked the feeling of being invited to dine in an Italian's home
The food was just as authentic
A fixed menu of Italian classics, like porchetta with polenta and garlicky Swiss chard, was balanced with a wide range of specials
The burrata appetizer, a grilled red pepper stuffed with basil, proscuitto and creamy burrata cheese, was amazing
The spinach gnocchi, pillow-light in a butter and sage reduction, melted in my mouth
We washed it down with a nice red Barbara
From the complimentary pate the chef sent at the beginning of our meal to the creamy tiramisu, everything was perfect
Sure, the prices are a little high, but considering everything from pastas to ice cream is made in house, it's worth it
Went there on a Friday night with my girlfriend and got seating immediately
we loved the look of the place and we were attended to promptly
the menu wasn't loaded with options, but seemed something worth trying
to make it simple, the food really wasn't that good (girlfriend interjects - awful!) and VERY overpriced
2 dinners, 2 apps, 4 glasses of wine - over $100!! you can definitely get a better meal at a better price in the neighborhood
also, the manager seemed to be berating one of the bus boys the whole night
you can tell the employee was working hard, busting his butt and he was just being brow-beaten

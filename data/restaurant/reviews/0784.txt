The $14 taco appetizer (one of the few Mexican dishes on the menu) was bland, small and overpriced
The tequila list may have been impressive, but the margaritas were weak and warm
Although the maitre'd catered to her patrons, the waiters were abrupt, obnoxious and generally unwelcoming
So if you are in the mood for Mexican, this is not the place for you
The food was bad, the service was worse, and the prices were outrageous for an establishment that pretends to be something that it is not
Our visit to New York was a great one
but the highlight was our first (we hope of many) to Pompano! A sheer delight
The food, service and ambience - all exceptional
But the halibut
wow!! A great experience!!
Had a great time here
Food was excellent and the setting is so pleasant
Felt like we were transported out of Manhattan
Service needed work though as waiter was overbearing and pushy
Food was so good though, we will definitely go back!
I was in NY for my 1st time in Sept
with my boyfriend
It was Friday Night and we decided that we wanted to eat Mexican food
The hotel that we were staying at recommened Pompano
WOW! We loved the food but the dessert was a delight
I believe it was called Nati's flan? I think I can't remember
The place for a Friay night was not packed
The balcony was pretty packed
I love this place and when I visit again I will be visiting again
Food has tons of flavor
However, the portions are too small
Entree was the size of an appetizer
If you're on a diet, this is the place for you
There is no bang for your buck here
If you go, do not get seated downstairs
I wish I could express in a few sentences the marvelous experience I had at Pampano
The smoked swordfish just melted in my mouth, the ceviches are something I have never tasted before, but the best were the garlic shrimp
They are marinated in galic and oil juices and by the time you eat them you better use your fingers to lick them
The recipe uses shrimp with shell since they preserve the juice much better and it just made me remember my childhood at the beach in Acapulco
another fabulous dish for lunch is the enchiladas topped with fresh cheese
For dessert, the chocoflan
enough said
Although the decor is fresh and pleasant, the food was horrible and extremely over priced
My order came out as one tiny 2 inch square piece of fish on a banana leaf, tasting so sour and foul that I could barely take three bites
Others tolerated their food, but the price was ridiculous for not enjoying one bite of our meals
i thought the service was decent (somewhat intrusive because there were too many people working) and the guacomole was AWESOME
The rest of the meal was overpriced for the type of food
Shrimp in sauce had tails still on that were hidden
Cheese on enchilladas wasnt melted
On the other hand, tequilla selection was fantastic
I think this place could be good if they concentrated on the food as much as the alcohol
I was not blown away at the food - it was good - but not great and at the price somewhat frustrating experience
Great room (eat upstairs) and wine list but I would not go back
Perhaps I made a wrong turn and had dinner at another restaurant by the same name
Things began well with excellent margaritas at the bar
The four of us were seated in the outdoors patio(not requested) and suffered through a muddled menu, indifferent food, a below average waiter, as well as excessive noise, wind and cold
It makes we wonder if the chef was taking a siesta at 8PM that night! I will approach rosey reviews by restaurant reviewers with much more sceptcism
We had a great time with our 7pm reservations at Pompano
We were seated promptly, the atmosphere was refreshing
The menu selection was good, and the portions were adequate
Take a date, and don't forget your Platinum card! I thought it was well worth the $180 tab, for appetizer, entree, dessert, and one drink
If you are looking for good high end mexican this is your place
The decor is fantastic
I have eaten upstairs in the dining room and had take out and both are superb
Pampano is a great treasure
The decor to the menu selection is incredibly impressive
The space
gorgeous
The menu inventive, but service was off
Waiter was a strange bird and when told we wanted to enjoy our dining experience and not be rushed through dinner, he assured us it takes 30 minutes to get entrees once food was ordered
Well, literally 7 minutes later we were being served dinner, with no apologies from the server who was too scared to come to our table
Never asked us how our meal was during or after we finished eating
It was not crowded at all, but enough people to make the place buzz
I spoke to the GM after the meal and we were treated to a glass of port and an assurance if we come back, it will not happen again
I hope the place survives, but this address could be cursed
Needs more lively music
There is a great bar with no patrons downstairs
This place was yummy! Great selection of seafood, everyone at my table enjoyed their food thoroughly
the space was also quite aesthetically pleasing, although a little loud
Would recommend it!
Pompano is truly refreshing mexican fare, a seafood menu that shows that the south of the border cuisine doesnt always have to include heavy cheeses, rice and meat
The ceviches are all interesting, and the remaining appetizers on the menu are worth a shot
The entrees give you an opportunity to sample some unique ingredients and preparations that make 'mexican seafood' a cuisine worth exploring
Pompano is going to be the next Dos Caminos, so get in there while you still can
The dining room upstairs is airy and light, and the dining on the terrace outside can't be beat
The food is pricey but amazing and totally worth it, and the shrimp quesadilla on the lunch menu can't be beat
Such a gem for an otherwise lackluster area
THe food is DELICIOUS and the waitstaff is very attentive without making you uncomfortable
Not to mention the georgous outdoor terrace
A great find
We were there for the opening and the food was amazing
Really liked the decor, feels like you are in the tropics and the service was great
Highly recommend the ceviches to start
portions are fare
The Scene Set in a pleasant white room with quasi-retro aqua and pink accents, fronted by a handsome, circular wine bar, Counter has a friendly air of cleanliness and competence
The staff are well-trained, eager to please--occasionally to the point of intrusive doting--and opinionated about the food and drink they serve
The Food An all-vegetarian take on mostly traditional Southern cuisine, with a few Asian and other flavors thrown in
Standouts among the Southern fare include a terrific lentil-based version of meat loaf with savory mashed potatoes, an excellent smoked-tofu po' boy and a couple of different burgers
A towering vegetable Napoleon with crisp polenta and cilantro pesto is also tasty, as are savory crepes filled with vegetables and smoked tofu, in potent orange-ginger sauce
Desserts, including a dry poppy seed cake and a Key lime pie that tastes of soy, are the only disappointments
Went with my girlfriend and her family last month
The food was prepared very nicely and the decor was very comfortable
Low light setting for romatic ambience, but was a bit too low that we have to use the candle on the table to see our menu
I felt the price was a bit pricy for the food, but a definitely good dating spot
Table was a bit small, but good for two ppl or dating setting

VERY fresh and tasty! I had a roll wrapped in cucumber with crab
delicious! very inventive rolls that taste wonderful
I look forward to going back! The owner, Danny was very nice as well!
We've been looking for a good go-to sushi place in our neighborhood and we finally found one! I almost want to keep it a secret, but the food and service were great
All for a fantastic price
I have dined all over NYC and I have never experienced a restaurant as awful as this one
We arrived and it took at least 15 minutes until our waiter came
After we ordered our food never arrived
When I finally asked, Is it always this slow the waiter replied yes
After my dinner came we were still waiting for his which never arrived
I finally asked them where it could be as he ordered a chicken noodle dish and they said that they ran out of noodles and would go to the store to buy some new ones
We said forget it, paid the check and left
My friends were at the next table and had the same experience and this was their second time there giving it another chance
This is one restaurant I will never go back to and it's a shame as the food was good
The Scene A typical midtown mix of loose-tie professionals and casually dressed tourists dine in the luxe exotica of this David Rockwell-designed space
Gold leaf-kissed walls, bamboo scattered about, tiny dishes of colorful spices and fresh orchids on every table--it's high-end tiki kitsch
Service is casual yet professional
The Food From the crab spring rolls to the slow-baked salmon with galangal sauce, dishes lack the bright, vibrant flavors indicative of Thai cuisine and instead, taste washed out and watered down
Bean curd lacks its promised crispness and lolls in a thin, nondescript pool
Duck, though cooked perfectly to medium-rare, is served with limp, cold bok choy
The one standout on the regular menu is the foie gras with grilled mango and bits of ginger--it's technically perfect and simply wonderful
Desserts are the best part of the meal, especially the piquant passion-fruit souffle
If you want to get a taste of where asian fusion began or what it should be like, you have to go to Vong
It was by far the best meal I have had in a long long time
The Tasting Plate rocks
There were so many flavors and textures that were working together to compliment and contrast
Everything I tried exploded with flavor, sweet, salty, and spicy were perfectly blanced
The food is very well thought out
Kudos to Jean George
I can't wait for my next meal

Dined at Vong the other night and had a really good time
The staff was really friendly and the food was delicious
The fois gras app stole the show for me, the mango, the ginger, and the liver worked so well together
The duck breast was cooked perfectly and the chocolate cake with cocunut sorbet was wam, cool, moist, and gooey!! The french-thai fusion was really unique and well executed
The space is truly beautiful, the main wall is a mixed media collage thats hard to describe but has to be seen
I have to say that there are not many other restaurants in New York that do things as well as Vong
I am a huge foodie and am deeply disappointed with the food quality in this restaurant
The taste, the combinations, and the appearance were all below average, even bordering bad
The atmosphere is ok but if you are looking for a place with good food, GO ELSEWHERE
The lemongrass coconut soup was white colored
The soup consisted of at least 1/2 coconut milk
The only flavor that came through was the fatty coconut
The papaya salad was bland
And the main dish was so unmemorable, I bother not mentioning it
The menu is very small and has little variety
I have eaten at hundreds of restaurants in NYC and this one is in the bottom few
I took my boo there last week cause she was straight triping about restaurant week and the place was nice but the food was so so
It was like an ecletic PF Changs
Do not reccomend highly
Didn't really like the wine list and the service was okay
The decor was pretty soothing and not trying too hard to be oriental
Also I liked the lighting of the atmosphere
Got the tasting appetizer menu - five of the items listed - and it was $24 each person
It was pretty good but my girlfriend and I cost around $50 already
The chicken soup with thai spices was my favorite out of all the dishes - the creamy, coconut milk flavored thick soup with I believe shitakemushrooms was awesome
For entree I would recommand the rabbit curry - the meat was cooked very finely and the curry sauce, though a bit too sweet, went well with rice
There are a lot of fish dishes as well
Desserts were good and my girlfriend believes that it is the best part of the meal
Would recommand the berry salad and sticky rice with mango
The berry salad was a very summer dish - berries, champagne, sorbet, and ginger flavored
cookie/cake
Coffee was mediocre
A few of us went for lunch during restaurant week
It was a fixed price of $25 + 20% tip included in the bill
I was not impressed
They only provided 2 options for each appetizer, main, and dessert (both sorbet)
Isn't 3 selections the norm? For the main, I ordered duck and the portion was the size of a small piece of beef jerkey
To say the least, I wasn't full
The desserts were both essentially the same, and the service was on the slow side
Despite the slow service, the bill already included a tip of 20%
Is this now the norm for poor service? What happened to 15% if the service is good? Overall, the experience was below average and I won't be making a return visit
There are much better selections in midtown
Cheerful and relaxed, Vong was a pleasant change from the frenetic, chi-chi restaurants that pepper New York's must-nosh-at list
The happy red chairs and warm yellow glow that suffuses the space makes the large room feel cozy and intimate
We shared an excellent foie gras and duck rolls to start with, followed by the spicy cod and rabbit curry, topped off with the lemongrass creme brulee and passionfruit souffle
Unlike traditional Thai restaurants that hit you between the eyes with the delightful, spine-tingling flavors of chili and coconut milk, all the flavors here are subtle and exotic in their own unique way
Every morsel was delectably ooh-worthy! However, I must say that the service lacks panache and speed and was a minor irritation in the midst of an otherwise perfect evening
I've become quite a fan of this place because it offers great service, delicious food and fantastic ambiance
If you want something different from the usual western cuisines, I highly recommend Vong
The prices are quite reasonable for what you're getting in return
I'm a Thai restaurant hound so I was a little skeptical about the place
The food was better than I expected
The ambiance was nice
The service was exceptional, as expected in a restaurant like this
All in all, a very enjoyable experience
NB: I had the prixe fixe lunch menu: grilled chicken veggies rice paper wrap, duck breast with tamarid sauce, and chocolate cake with coconut sorbet
I've heard a lot of good things about this place
Their food is only okay
I've had better- much, much better
Their ginger margaritas are very good though
It is definitely a must try
Ambience wasn't bad either
I probably wouldn't go back
It's fun to try only once
We went to Vong on a saturday night, and had a great experience
All of the food was superb
Each appetizer was excellent, as were the coctails
The waiters were attentive, speedy, and knowledgeable
Our entrees were amazing (salmon and sea bass), and though we declined to have dessert the chef sent us out a special martini glass full of wine flavored sorbet

had the hamburger
Stick to McDonalds
My date had the Omelette
I could have invited her to my place and cooked one better
Right near central park
I'd recommend the place for the coffee, ambiance and the music
They say the Upper West Side has many trendy restaurants, but few good ones
Well, Vince Eddies is one of the best in the whole City
Everything about this cozy place is welcoming and rewarding! All of the staff exceed any expectation of service and courtesy
even the first time you go, you feel like a regular guest
The food is superb, with their own twists and touches to always make dining there a unique and enjoyable experience
Try their calamari, you'll never want marinara again!!!
A cozy restaurant on the upper west side, this restaurant comes complete with a fireplace, live acoustics by a violinist and eight-string guitarist, and Sunday afternoon choices like curry chicken salad, mesclun salad, and eggs benedict
It was Sunday brunch at its best
One of my first experiences with Vince Eddie's was when I moved into the neighborhood in July
The owner of the restaurant gave us a free round of drinks to welcome us to the neighborhood
The food is wonderful
From filet mignon, calve's liver, gourmet meatloaf, basa to trout, everything we've tried so far has been wonderful
The calamari is by far the most exceptional, the most tender I've ever tasted
and its side of the jalapeno-cilantro sauce compliments it to a T (forget the usual marinara, this sauce is tops)
Their specials vary and are exceptional
On weekends, they have the quaintest brunch
with live classical music
Try their Austrian oven-baked apple pancakes
They also have an outdoor garden with an outdoor fireplace
The waitstaff always remembers us and are prompt to greet us
This is by far the best restaurant experience I've had for the right price
The service here is rather bland - the waiter being of the smirked-nose etiquette
The restaurant is one of many on the Avenue so reservations are not needed despite the impressions that you might get
The decor inside is nice to observe while you wait and wait for the food
For an Italian restaurant it is rather average with its dishes, however the creme de la creme is their own bakery
The white bread filled to the brim with tomato soup is alone worth coming for and paying for
Otherwise, this is something that is tolerable but no distinctive
i have come here numerous times, usually for special occasions since its a little pricey, but oh so good
the waiters are very attentive and friendly
the food is absolutely amazing - can really never go wrong with whatever you order
Very unassuming from the outside but inside is a warm, homey atmosphere, simple but delicious Italian classics and great service
There are tons of little italian joints like this on the UWS - but this is one of the best ones
And the price is great too!!
This place is the restaurant to go to for good, consistent Italian food
Nothing on the menu is weird or fusion like, but it just tastes good and the drinks are mixed well
Nice homey place to take a small party to or your significant other for a romantic dinner
I've been diing here for 10 years and have never been disappointed
Great food at reasonable prices
I take all of my out of town guests here and have never regretted it
Peter (the owner and host) is the best
I have been to this restaurant many many times and have NEVER been disappointed
The hostess service are the best that I have ever experienced in NYC
The food is delicious and the ambience is wonderful
Only bummer is that they don't take reservations
I left New York a year ago and moved to Colorado
I miss everything about New York but the two things I miss the most are the restaurants and shopping in Soho
Out of all the restaurants I ate at (and I covered quite a lot of ground) my staple, the place I crave more than anything, is Pomodoro Rosso
I used to take every person who came to visit me there, and I suggest it to every person who ever goes there
I am coming out to visit this summer and you better believe, the first place I go for dinner will be this place!
THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT TIME
ILL DEFINITELY RETURN FOR MORE
POMODORO WAS A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD FIND
Big plate pasta makes everybody happy!! Try the spaghetti Alfred
It's not in the menu
This place is great if you want homey, good and hearty Italian food
Like the other reviewers, there is nothing that knocks out down on the menu but that's what you need once in a while and Pomodoro delivers
The ambiance is warm and inviting and the drinks are done well
I always have a great time when we visit here
Don't forgo the bread sticks and olive oil
I've never had better
This is probably my favorite restaurant in the city! I went there once just to try and now I go every week
The specials are outstanding, as is the pasta with ricotta and the maltadena with meatsauce is outstanding
Even their bread is outstanding
The wait staff can get busy, but they usually have a smile on their face
Worth trying
Nothing fancy, yet nothing ordinary
It's just really good Italian home-made quality fare
Pastas are your best bet
It's really good! They are made fresh and flavorful
Good atmosphere
The service was outstanding
I spent $50 for an app, an entree, an excellent bottle of wine to share, and the tip, so I didn't feel robbed in any way
It was worth every dollar spent
I would come here again
Great neighborhood place
Nothin' fancy or too inventive
just huge portions of really good italian food
I've gone several times and always had a great experience!
i tried this place for the first time a few months ago
since then i've been there an embarrassing number of times
it's a great place to go to for great italian food without a lot of fuss
the menu is extensive and there are daily specials
the host is always very friendly and courteous
i've never had a bad experience
only bummer is that there's usually at least a 20 minute wait
i usually spend about $35/person for a drink, shared appetizer, entree, shared dessert, tax and tip
Unpretentious, good food
GREAT bread olive oil to start
I've never been disappointed here
Crowded
My friend and I went here looking for the good food other reviews had mentioned but found quite the opposite
The menu was misleading and the specials were overpriced
Food had no flavor
The only redeeming part of the dinner was the wine which was complimentary after being so disatisfied with the meal

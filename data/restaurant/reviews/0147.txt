For entrees we order the lasagne with rabbit ( a must) and the lamb with creamy polenta
Make sure you leave room for desserts and the white chocolate bread pudding is the way to go
This truly has become our new favourite restaurant the service was fantastic and friendliest in New York
I love Peasant
It's the only place I can bring my parents where they won't complain
If that's not a complement I don't know what is
Our favorites are all carbs, (my parents never even heard of Dr
Atkins) the pizza marg, the gnochi, the spaghetti with clams, all grade A primo food
My girlfriend loves the pear tart, we can all share one but she always has to have her own!
Had my bachelorette dinner at Peasant
No, it wasn't crazy, just ladies getting together to enjoy ggod company and ggod food
We were all very civil, until the pastas came, we did family style and I don't know if the girls ate that day but they acted as if they had never eaten
Gnocchi, linguine, lasagne, and a caviar pasta, better than anything we've ever had
Unfortunately after all the great food and yummy cocktails (the bartender named one after my sis) we went home early
Oh well, there's still time for vegas!!!
I love peasant
Started going when I first moved to the neighborhood 5 years ago and the food keeps getting better
I know alot of people hate the italian menu but I crave it
I especially love the lamb
It's flavorful and rare
Two ways I can never get lamb in this city
The desserts are simple but good as well as the wines
For a special treat skip dessert and have a grappa! It will help you digest so that by the time you get home you're hungry for more!
I usually don't think about the opportunity cost of the hypothetical dinners I'm giving up, that is until Peasant tonight
The only positive is the ambiance which is a trendy, dimly lit tratt with exposed brick
Our waiter, I think his name was Kosta, was as bad as I've had in recent memory- snide, resented translating the Italian menu which is part of the kitsch novelty of this place, and totally inequitable in time allocation across his tables, meaning we saw him at the beginning and check time
There was absolutely nothing in-between
The pizza as an app was adequate, but with Lombardi's and deMarco's around the corner, what's the point
The menu was much too narrow - 4 pastas and 6 meat dishes or so
The only attractive pasta dish was the gnochi with morels
The sauce was literally campbell's cream of mushroom, and the menu should have more honestly portrayed 'morels' as 'morel
' However, the gnochi themselves had really nice texture and were cooked al dente
I would sooner slit my wrists before returning here

I had a HORRIBLE experience at Peasant
this restaurant was the perfect example of what how one should NEVER be treated when dining out
Went with 3 friends, started with a nice bottle of wine
Service began very well, the menu is in Italian, so the waiter came over and went over the whole menu with us
We order 3 apps and a pizza, as well as the Pork pulled off the bone as our entrees
The apps were fine
nothing to write home about
The Pizza was actually quite good
Unfortunately, when our entrees came, 3 of the 4 diners thought the pork tasted strange
When we finally got our waiters attention - and explained to him we were unhappy with our entrees, his demeanor changed completely, he took our dishes and walked away without taking another order for us or asking if he could get us anything else
Then
2 mins
later, he came back (with plates still on his arm) and told us that he would put another order in for us if we liked but that he couldn't take these entrees off our bill
We asked to speak to the manager - who informed us that this was Milk fed Succulent Pig and that there was nothing wrong with the dish and therefore would not be able to take it off the bill
He had the nerve to argue with us for about 5 mins
about this before we finally became irrate and told him we were not going to pay for dishes that we did not eat
In the end, they got us other entrees, which took about 1/2 hour to come out
While waiting, we could see the chef talking to our server, and shouting about those fu*ing idiots - which was very clear that he was talking about the guest who sent back the dishes
Overall - it was a horrible dining experience and I'm sorry that we spent over $300 to be treated the way we were
Do go to this dimly lit, pretentious, trattoria wanna be
Seated, they make it obvious you will be rushed
My appetizer was inedible
Our waiter flew by asking Is everything alright tried to stop him but he continued flying by
I had to ask a busboy to get him
I explained about the appetizer
He was interested and did not offer any suggestion or resolution
I cancelled the entrees and asked for the check
He finally asked is there something else I can bring? I repeated, just my check please
The manager appeared and asked What is the problem here? I explained about the appetizer and he told me curtly, We make 100's of these each day
In other words, I had the problem not them
I asked for the check again and he dropped it on the table without an apology or a thank you
My experience was not at the restaurant upstairs but at the wine cellar/restaurant below
Candles line the stairs that escort you to doors that resemble those you would find in a farm or cabin
You pass through the red curtains and enter a very cozy and charming space with communal tables and a small bar with plenty of space for eating
Check out the bathroom! One of the cleanest in NYC! Wine was great
The attention of the wait staff magnificent
For Valentine's Day, they blanketed the tables with red rose petals
Cheese platter was indeed good
The menu of Italian dishes are not your standard fare-- a bit of an exotic touch
Without a doubt, a unique experience
I've eaten at Peasant numerous times and have always enjoyed my experience
The cuisine is Italian comfort food
The wine list is much improved with some good options
The service on the other hand is spotty
It is very clear that the Italian menu (no English translations) are a huge burden not only to non Italian speaking cutomers but to the wait staff who now has the added task of translating the entire menu
This adds to thier curt attitude and deisre to rush
I am a huge fan of tradition but when it begins to compromise the experience I say it's better to accomodate your clientele -please
Went to Peasant last nite and had great food
The decor is okay, the service okay but the food is wonderful! Better than we expected, my girl loved the pasta with truffles, I had a great squab, wine list had some good buys
If you're looking for good food try it, but if you need a scene or a celebrity chef go elsewhere!
The menu was in Italian- might as well have been in Esperanto;that put us at the mercy of the waiter for recommendations
The place was crowded to capacity late Wednesday night (so much for being a romantic destination); the decor was nice but thats where it ended
Being a vegetarian probably robbed me of a good meal but i didnt expect to be served bland pasta
Turned out to be an expensive meal in a loud setting
Went here with my family day after Thanksgiving and even though I had absolutely no appetite I couldn't stop eating
I originally only ordered a salad because I overindulged the night before but when the food came I was eating off everyone's plate, well not everyone, my brother ordered sardines
Anyway I tried the duck, gnocchi, risotto, lamb and my fave was the bread pudding! Now I'm as stuffed as a turkey! The only drawback is that the winelist is only Italian and my Dad only drinks big Californian red!
This is the review to rely upon--I read dozens of reviews of Peasant and they were correct--the service is awful
The wannabe model hostess and maitre'd were rude and made us wait for 30 mins
despite the fact that we had a reservation
The Ikea chairs are uncomfortable
There are only two restrooms for the entire restaurant
The food is hit-or-miss but the fish is subpar and the desserts are forgettable
My experiences, numbering about one per week over a five year period, have been outstanding
I am hard person to please and critical of restaraunts, i am focused first on the food when i dine out
Peasant is the ONLY restaurant whose food i find my self craving almost daily, i have never had a reservation

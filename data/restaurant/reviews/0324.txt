The Cuban decor, and sense of classic decay was nicely captured
Didn't Love: So-so service, the artificial wait time when there were many two-top tables available
It says something that the owner of the reastaurant (who is so typically Cuban) walks around and greets every customer
He asks how everything is and is glad you are having a good time
The ambience is wonderful, its impossible to dine here and not leave in a great festive mood
Perfect place for a date or for a group of friends
In the summer, the doors are open and the food is wonderful-- especially for its price
Definately recommend!
If you're a nervous drinker do not go here on a date
They have the most delicious mango martinis and mojitos that will go down like juice and go straight to your head
One of my favorite NY Restaurants
Sophisticated without being pretentious
Great live Cuban band
Must make reservations to eat
Or you can always just sit at the bar a eat there like I often do when I just drop in for a great meal
The staff is friendly too
Son Cubano had great food, candles burning on every table a band that had the crowd dancing in between the tables (there is NO dance floor)
And on a Wednesday night!!!!
We arrived to find the atmosphere very upbeat with a live band playing, a large, filled dining area and two good sized bars both crowded with well-dressed people
The cocktails were very tasty, we all had Mojitos and Sangria
The waiters are very busy (and cute), but easy to flag down and quite nice
The food was great
We were satisfied and enjoyed Son Cubano immensely
I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone
We celebrated my sister's birthday on Saturday, 1/4/03 at Son Cubano
Overall, we had a good time except for two things
I asked our waiter to place a candle on my sister's dessert so we could all sing Happy Birthday which is typically done at most restaurants without a problem
Instead, our waiter, dropped the dessert in front of her and kept walking
We sang to her anyway but were surprised that he did not honor my small request
After spending almost $500 at most NYC restaurants, their management usually offers a complimentary drink
Well, not at this place!! I approached the manager about this issue and he blew me off by stating that they do not have this practice at Son Cubano
He told me to see him next time I came by so that he could work something out
Don't hold your breath for a return visit CHEAPO!!!!
I read some poisitive reviews on Cutysearch about this place, but boy were we let down
The scene is pretty cool and the drinks are OK, but the food and service were pretty weak
I won't be going back,
I have been to this place before, and I really enjoyed myself
I'm new to the city and one of the bartender's made me feel really welcome (I think his name was Joe) He made an out of towner feel like I belonged
So I returned with some friends and to my dismay my favorite bartender no longer worked there and management was completely rude to me and my guests
When I asked politely when I would be seated, he told me in front of my friends that I would have to wait just like all the regular folk Management reminded me of how rude some NYorkers can be
I doubt we will ever return
Where did Joe go??
Live latin band along with high ceilings makes you nostalgic for Havana or at least Lincoln road
The painting on the wall needs to go else it was all Cubano
Cool setting, great mojitos, and good live music make for a hip vibe
but food is just average and management needs to learn a thing or two about customer service
Late-night DJ is so ear-splittingly loud you can't hear the person right next to you
Went with a group, and repeated complaints to the waiter/manager about the noise level fell on rude and deaf ears (must have been the DJ)
Such unpleasantness did not warrant the 20% tip that was automatically added to our tab
On seeing we left less, the manager refused to return our credit cards until we agreed to pay the full amount
Will never return -- my pesos are better spent somewhere that appreciates them!
The food is great and the bands that play are just as good
Wait staff is courteous and very helpful with suggestions from the menu
Highly recommended for a romantic dinner for two or a night out with a big group
best mojitos in town!!! the bartender artiom or something like that was great
when i finaly could get a table the food was awesome and the band was like having buena vista social club live!!!! i recomend this place to everybody!!!!
you got to go there it`s amazing great food not too expensive and big portions!!! great service!!! the only problem is that you may wait up to 45 minutes for a table even if you have a reservation
but the music the food the service and the mojitos worth it!!!
well, you still haven't if you go here
Excellent bar scene
One looonnnnggg bar and mojitos and rum drinks up the yinyang
And YES all the bar staff look like they were hired from an International Male catalouge
but then try an order a drink
ones looking at himself in the mirror, another couldn't possibly step away from 2 young hot things he was talking to, 3 others were having there own conversation time and the one I finally got was very new and didn't know any of the menu
but hey, it was HIS first night
Then the food, mass produced, cold, mediocre, tired versions of cuban classics
Throw in a overworked, understaffed waitgroup and you got a combination!! I have been here several times and yes to BAR, no to RESTAURANT
Great food, great service, and a fun, energetic atmosphere
The live band is very good
My only complaint would be that the place can get a bit loud at times, making it hard to hear conversation
But I would recommend this place to anyone looking for unique and flavorful cuisine and a fun night out
Must go back to try more dishes
the menu is just too full of enticing options
Oh, and it won't break the bank either!
Amazing waiter - I will call him the tan one b/c he did not tell me his name - fabulous music created a fun atmosphere, hip, and the coconut shrimp was so damn good
I think this is my new spot - hostess was lovely - no attitude and seated us promptly
I really like this place
The night begun with a couple of us waiting at the bar for the rest of our party
The best at this point was the live music
Actually it was what I liked best about the restaurant along with the guayaberas that the waiters and bartenders wore
And of course the food was really, really good, spicy and very tasty and I had hoped
If there was anything that I didn't like it was that although our waiter was very handsome, he was a vain! :-)
This was one of the best nights that we had in NYC, such great live music, a fun crowd and the appetizers are all tasty, spicy and delicious
We had a table full of appetizers and mojitos and the price was right!
i went last monday and this place was full!!! mojitos and the service are the best part in there
Very nice addition to the neighborhood
And a great follow up from Flor de Sol (I hear that it is owned by the same person)
This place is a wonderful place to catch up over mojitos at the bar and an even better place once you sit down and eat
I definitely recommend this place
Fun atmosphere, great music
Can't speak for the food because I didn't eat there but I can speak for the drinks, service and atmosphere
The mojitos at this Cuban classic are very tasty, good selection of beer and perfection with the mixed spirits
However, the guys behind the bar don't know the first thing about making a bloody mary
Skill set to work on
The restaurant/bar provides a very romantic setting if you are looking for a good date spot
The service is good and the live music gets the latin blood in all of us going
This place is a great addition to the neighborhood, and the owners are really friendly
The scene is great and they even have live music a couple of nights a week
Definitely should check it out
Very nice latin party-atmosphere! Friendly staff, good food, and very inexpensive for Manhattan! A good place to start the evening since it's in the hip Meatpacking district!

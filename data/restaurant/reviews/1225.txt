Her excitement rose as she watched it come out of the oven onto her plate! My wife - the pasta meat lover - tried the paccheri genovese and found a new favourte dish
the only thing that stopped her from ordering more was to leave room for the tiramisu' - another exceptional choice
I, on the other hand am a fish eater, so I started off with the polipetti - baby octopus in a wonderful tomato sauce, and followed that with the scialatelli - homemade pasta topped with lots of seafood, in a light spicey broth
It was heaven to my lips
I'm sure we will be going back regularly, regardless of our commute from across town!
I have finally found an affordable Italian restaurant, with great food a chef that is actually from Italy! The place is comfortable, the food is delicious, the owner staff are young energetic
I eat there at least once a week the unique and extensive selection of specials keeps me going back for more
I noticed all the other reviews are old, so I suggest all you people go back check it out
One night I ate at Peperoncino with my fiance, and another couple
My entree of cheese stuffed (cheap cheese at that) ravioli with salmon tossed on top (a dish which had been described as Seafood Ravioli which is a completely different thing!) was literally uncooked
The ravioli was raw gooey dough
I sent it back, after some effort convincing the waiter something was wrong
Then they made some attempt to cook it, not sure what happened, it was still a horror and I just couldn't eat it
It was revolting
So I got soup and went hungry
My friend ordered lasagna and told us Weight Watchers lasagna is better
And the prices! I can't believe what they were charging for the Seafood Ravioli I had ordered
Steer clear
It's not like there aren't plenty of really excellent pizza places already on 5th Ave
The neighborhood didn't need Peperoncino
I know everyone else seems to be really mad but i ate the pizza and a salad and I thought it was delicious
I watched the pizza cook in the oven and was excited when it arrived at the table all funny shaped bubbley and burn spotted
MMMMMMM I put this brick oven pizza up against any of the other places in the city
I can't vouch for the lamb but I view this place as a pizza place and it has never dissapointed
The outside presentation of the restaurant was very inviting, good location and atmosphere
The service was not great, the wait staff were not clear on the ingredients and or preparation details of the meals
There is not customer service offered for mishaps
Way to pricey for the type of service, food selection and small portions
Doubt I will go back!
The decor was nice, the service was indifferent and the food was uniformly awful
My pasta was so salty that it was inedible (and I like plenty of salt on my food)
My wife had the rack of lamb
It wasn't as bad as the pasta, but they used really cheap meat
We wouldn't have been so disappointed if they weren't charging $28 for the dish
Also-- the waitress didn't take anything off of the bill when we politely explained why we hadn't eaten more than a couple of bites of our food
There are too many good Italian restaurants on 5th Avenue to waste any time with this place
3 pasta dishes came out of the kitchen totally devoid of any salt -- used most of our salt cellar to bring something resembling taste to the dish
Meat cheese platter was 99% meat and 3 matchsticks of cheese
Our Italian waitress lost her thick accent half-way through the meal and reverted to her Brooklyn accent
Cash only makes me wonder who is ordering $70 bottles of wine
Would avoid this place, but if forced to go, I hear the pizzas are ok
I went there with my date last night
Surprisingly, it was really a hip thai restaurant in town
It was really a tiny place but full of beautiful smiles
It was certainly a great service here
It was a touch of sincerity and care to customers beside the delicious food
My girlfriend and I would like to say Thank you to all of the staff at Tiny Thai for our special dinner that you made us a beautiful evening
Nice scene but small
Good entrees but stay away from the appetizers and the pumpkin custard
I dont know who came up with this dessert but it was TERRIBLE i cant begin to tell you what it tasted like
They also have a very limited drink menu consisting of just beer and wine
Its the entrees and good service that make this place worthwhile
I came from india as a young boy
I was fall in love with Thai food 10 years ago
I ate out a lot of Thai places in town
I love Thai curries, especially, The Panang curry
It was at Tiny that I had the best Panang curry dish
It was so rich in taste and just the right touch on the spicy
I am falling in love with this tiny restaurant
Superb!!!
When it thinks of the authentic Thai eateries in the west side dining scene, Tiny Thai is tops
It is really good quality Thai foods here
The salmon with capers, asparagus and roasted red pepper in panang curry sauce is a delicious entree that never fails to satisfy me
In addition to the generous portions and cool atmosphere its partrons may fall in love with this Tiny
Top-notch
This Thai place is in the trend and fashion
It has a style with european feeling right down to its attractive modern decor
It's tiny but gorgeous and charming spot on 9 Ave
We have ate here couple times
The food is well priced and delicious
We are not trying to say This is the best but surely is the real star
The efficient service keeps things moving
I was recommended to Tiny Thai by the W hotel's concierge on the evening
I had thrilled with the interior design of the establishment
It's cozy and modern
I ordered the atlantic sea ( one of tiny best dish ) it was a superb choice and lot of beautiful smiles from the service
I ate many thai places in town including Sea, Planet Thailand, and Joya
I start to have another favorite in mind that is Tiny Thai on ninth avenue
The foods are tasty but not every item on the menu
I ate the very tasty Pad Thai last night
This easygoing inventive Thai is Hip

Wonderfully exotic Thai restaurant, it is located in midtown Manhattan
We love this trendy and tasty Thai mini spot on 9 Ave
Admittedly, We love the called Tiny's best menu
We love the combination green
( the combination of mixed vegetables cooking with thai chili herbs sauce) We like the chic look of the place so much
It's very simple design but stylish and unique
We eat out a lot of restaurant on the west side
Tiny Thai has its own character and style
It is a small Thai restaurant but very charming
We went to dine there last night
We were surprising to see a lot of sexy people in this tiny spot
Food was nice presentation
A nice touch!!!

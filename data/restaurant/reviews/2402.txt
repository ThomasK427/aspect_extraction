The hosts were very sarcastic and curt
My friends and I had to wait 20 minutes before we were approached by our server (and I had to go to the manager just to get service!)
After he served us, he gave us our check quickly so we felt rushed
When I was with my uncle, the wait was for 2 hours but they told me to come back in an hour
I did and when I asked the host how much longer he thought my wait time would be he looked me up and down, rolled his eyes and said, Well, see, you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(rattled off until 18) parties ahead of you, so I would think that you'd have to wait a WHILE
They also told me that you could call ahead, put your name on the list so that the wait time includes your commute time and when I called ahead, the host said, You're calling ahead? Then the wait time for you is 33 HOURS
You might want to come down in person to put your name down
I love the desserts, but I don't need a side of attitude with it
The first I came, it is really great, the second too
The lastest I came back, it was terible, mistake order, my dessert came before appetizer
I don't know what happened
Worst service
And they give me the check before I finish my dish, because it is so busy and they need the table what they said
After that ?, I may not comeback again
My brother and I decided to try Serendipity after we saw the movie of the same name
We were so smitten with the movie, that we made a special day trip out to NYC (We're from Chicago) to eat there
While the wait is long, and the waitstaff is a bit pushy, this restaurant is completely worth the wait
After reading the reviews on here I can understand why people can be upset with service, but they do need to understand that this is NYC!!! Get used to it
To make a long story short, we were very impressed with the service and food, (good enough for 5 subsequent trips each year) and we even met Mr
Steven Bruce, who owns the place, and he seated us at the same table that the movie was filmed at
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, MAKE RESERVATIONS FAR IN ADVANCE TO AVOID LONG WAIT TIMES
I was so excited to try Serendipity 3
Let's just say it wasn't the experiene I had envisioned
First of all, since it was Easter WEEK, not weekend, but week, they did not accept reservations
The wait was ober 90 minutes! Since the waiting area is so small inside nearly 20 people were waiting outside
but, you had to hear the host (a complete jerk) call your name only one time inside to be seated
If you weren't inside or didn't hear your name, then you were SOL
We finally were seated
Our server- no personality
I ordered the worst burger ever
the bun was from one of those 8 packs you get for 99 cents at the grocery store
The Frrozen hot chocolate was very good
but not worth all the above
Oh, and I did buy a packet of the Frrozen hot chocolate mix from yet another rude employee
AVOID
I just wanted to say the management must have felt the same way as the writer did
My boyfriend in starting their today as the host and he is very pleasant
so please don't let one jerk form your opinion
They ruined the experience at hello caught myself and my party completely off guard
I was expecting a child friendly cool and groovy place, instead we got Homey the clown conking heads at the front door
I have no idea what planet these so called hosts are from, but in this universe people are generally nice and usually cordial, not under the roof of Serendipity 3 these rules do not apply
It actually appeared that these people go out of their way to be rude and mean
Once seated the waiter finally appeared, the food was fine, the desserts were good, the presentation was better than the desserts themselves and not particually special
The bottom line is that there is no excuse for bad behavior PERIOD
It appears that what we did to provoke this behavior was to walk in the door and say party of 6


Staff not RUDE, theyre FIRM which is necessary due to impatient/pushy patrons
Host and waiter were great for us because we had the common sense to stay out of the way until seated for our reservation
Food was excellent which surprised us due to lukewarm reviews
Prices are high but it is the UES so what can you expect? They have some basic stuff for the less adventurous (burgers, hot dog) but I suggest taking a chance on something unusual
My Haight-Ashbury was a delicious and off-beat turkey sandwich
Husbands bacon cheeseburger and fries were excellent also
Frrrozen Peanut Butter Hot chocolate was something between a milkshake (not as thick) and smoothie (not as icy)
Very rich in flavor and large enough for 2! Despite this we also got the apple pie
Not the best weve ever had, but definitely delicious with its cinnamon walnut crumble topping
Please note they do not allow strollers in the restaurant
You can check your stroller across the street at the parking garage; but we didn't think it was worth it
I stayed outside with the sleeping baby; my husband and 4 year old ate inside
The hot dog was bad and expensive
There are many other places in New York worth trying
Skip this one
Today was just like the movie One Fine Day, A beautiful overcast/rainy NYC day, though I have lived here for eight months and the New York magic has definately worn away, this place brought back that special fantastic wonder and excitement of all NYC has to offer
The ambience, the fantastic deserts, the decor all of it was straight out of the movie and by far worth one if not several trips!
We had shared a bacon cheeseburger and a Frrrozen Hot Chocolate
cheeseburger was great but small even if it wasn't shared, but the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate was awesome
perfect for sharing!
My two best friends and I had heard many many good things about Serendipity 3, and decided to try it out
We had to put our names down and wait, so we came back after about two hours and were finally seated
Let me tell you, the food was most definitely worth the long wait
It was the best food I have ever eaten, especially the desserts
If you want to know what a real restaurant is, I VERY HIGHLY recommend Serendipity 3
If for nothing else, go for a Frrrozen Hot Chocolate
It really is the greatest culinary creation of all time!
You're definately going to have to book reservations, otherwise you're probably not getting in, especially if you're rolling with a large party
And please don't try to hassle with the overstressed waitstaff
Their just trying to keep the little sardine-packed shop organized
The restaurant is sardine-packed around the clock
Dinner here isn't the best, it's more about the dessert
But but
There's really nothing special, but it's really the experience that counts
Basically, it's just like you strolled into a Friendly's and enjoyed dinner and ice cream
The frozen hot chocolate (as seen on Oprah) is basically a milkshake and the caviar burger must be some ritzy take on the hamburger but with caviar for any fanny-packed idiot to fall for, simply to take in the thrill of eating on the UES
since the restaurant sits on East 60th in the heart of the UES
I love this place despite the wait
They have great food, and yes, it is over priced, but its so good that you end up not caring
Its a carefree lighthearted environment and it is great for families and dates
EXPECT TO WAIT UP TO TWO HOURS
thats how popular it is
The good thing about that is, because of where its places, you can put you name on the list, go to the movies around the corner, and then come back with a table ready
For Families, Dylans Candy Bar is at the corner and there are other places near by that make this a great choice
If you dont go for anything else, go for the DESSERTS
with things like Frozen Hot Chocolate, Du Yu Fondu, and Strawberry's in Cream
you can't go wrong!
serendipity 3 must have family members in both Zagats and Frommers! I am shocked that this restaurant would have been so highly reccommended by both sources
NYC is one of the most multicultural and dynamic cities in the world, with some of the greatest restaurants! Serendipity was incredibly overrated, (the decor was not whimsical at all, and the food was way below average, as well as being very very overpriced!!! (A $12 sandwich was highly uncalled for!!) This place is a state of mind place!!!!!!! With so many other fantastic restaurants in NYC, why anyone would wait on a 1 to 2 hour waiting line is beyond me
Our waiter was very nice, however, he was very much overworked, thus, the service was incredibly slow!!!!! Please, do not fall into any traps!!! Serendipity 3 is not worth your time and your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
With bad service that you can recieve here, why is this narrow, narrow, tiny place always, always sardine-packed?? Oh, right, it's a family-unfriendly TOURIST TRAP
Serendipity has a gift shop with take-home goodies, but these tourists are honestly experiencing Serendipity 3 already, if they have ever stepped in a Friendly's

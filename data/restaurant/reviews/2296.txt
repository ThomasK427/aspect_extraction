Daniel himself even came over to our table to speak with us
Wow! Gorgeous dining room
Very friendly service was impeccable and made you feel welcome
The value you get for the money is astounding
We ordered the regular $98/ person price fixe three course dinner
We were presented with a three tier tray of extra small appetizers and an extra dessert (chocolate yule log with meringue mushrooms) to share in addition to the ordered items
The little things set the service apart: everyone at the table is served at once and a small loaf of baked bread in a nice gift bag was presented to us upon leaving the restaurant
Can't wait to go back to New York and dine at Daniel again!
Who knew butternut squash soup could be so good? At Daniel, the service
food, atmosphere and experience was unbelievable
The waitstaff was extremely attentative to our needs and although we felt like taking an etiquette class after dining there, we were extremely satisfied with the delicious food
We went with the 4-course tasting menu which was just right
Loved the Braised Short ribs , which was aged for 32 hours in delicious sauce
It was a wonderful birthday dinner for my bf
Make sure to make reservations 1 month in advance and call early! 7pm spots go fast! Great place to take someone special
No doubt this place more than lived up to it's reputation
The place is beautiful, you never want to leave
From cocktails at the bar to the final taste of the wonderful dessert it was all spectacular
Food, service, timing
all perfect
Go for business, pleasure ora special time
eat everything
Too many items to recommend just 2 or 3
If only the wine was a bit more reasonable
I live in boston and have always heard about daniel
When I finnaly got the chance to go, It more than lived up to my expectations
We arrived late for our reservation , but were still sat promptly
we got the 8 course tasting menu and every single course was perfect
service was attentive
and ambiance was very nice
I cant wait to come back
Its a great place for special occations
be prepared to devote some time to this dinner its about three hour long if you do it right
we even got to meet daniel balud
he came to the table and said hello
what an unsuspected treat
overall i believe this is the best restaraunt i've ever been to
I think this is the best french restaurant in the city
Everything from service to food was flawless
The place is beautiful and full of class
You must go and try it for yourself
They also provide a huge wine list
The only word I can think of for this place is perfection
My wife and I have spent our last two aniversaries at Daniel and intend on coming back next year for our 25th
Both evenings were outstanding
The food and the service were remarkable
You feel as if your dining alone even when the dining room is fully occupied
Each visit we asked for help with our wine selection and were extremely pleased with the recommedations
We also mentioned we were there for our aniversary and were treated to a special dessert
We intend to spend many more anniversaries at this truly special resturant
This dinner was simply excellent, friendly and amazing
I don't need to say more
This was our best fine dining experience in NY
As compared to L'Orangerie in Los Angeles, this French restaurant wins hands down on service and food
The reviews are excellent and rated amoung one of the top restaurants
Plan on spending a pretty penny as their dishes average over $50/plate
It's a must to order a nice bottle of French wine at your table or you're truly doing yourself a disservice of having one of the most memoriable experiences
They are gay friendly and serve all customers with true professionalism and courtesy
We received some great tips on what to do in NY while chatting with our server
This is probably true because the reviews are way too high and the patrons were probably visiting from Boca
My four dishes were all flavorless
I thought that the bland lobster appetizer was intended to make me crave the next big-flavored dish
Then, when the potato crusted Sea Bass was as tasteless, I felt that the prime rib has to be amazing
It wasnt
The food was an expensive disappointment
My wife and I dined here for our anniversary, from the food to the service it was wonderful
One of the best restaurants we have ever been too
From the opulent dining room to the delicious food and impeccable service - I highly recommend for a special night out! we went all out for the grand tasting menu with wine pairings (pistachio crusted foie gras was out of this world!) and were not disappointed
We never felt rushed as the waitstaff was excellent at not clearing our wine glasses until we were fully finished with a pairing
Even saw Chef Boulud walking around the dining room and got a tour of the kitchen
Having dined there several times, I say without equivocation that Daniel is the best upscale restaurant in New York
I can find no fault with any aspect of the cuisine, of the ambience, or of the staff
Daniel himself treats each patron as if he or she were the only perosn in the place, as he has done since he started the place more than a decade ago at his 76th Street location
Whether it is the full blown tasting menu (let them decide the wines, but do not miss the Cuvee Daniel Champagne or the specially bottled Pinot Noir from Oregon), a bite of chese at the bar, a salad or a dinner, you'll be hard pressed to do better
We were truly spoiled on this night
Not only was the tasting menu divine (all except the amuse, not what I would have expected), but the service was impeccable as was the skill of the sommelier who matched wines perfectly with the fair
I still need to call him back and find out what that sweet wine was that he suggested
What was really amazing and what added to our experience was Chef Daniel came out and chatted with us for quite a while
I went to Daniel for a special occasion and was thrilled that dining at Daniel made the special occasion even more special
Service and food were exceptional
The wait-staff was attentive to all our needs
The food was very tasty and sublime
The only draw back was the dessert, I expected better dessert from Daniel
But over all it was an amazing experience
I have been to Daniel a couple of times and would definitely continue going
The service and food was amazing
My bf and I got 100% service plus we received a dessert on the house to celebrate our anniversary that evening
This is definitely a must try place
Pricing is a bit steep but worth every penny of it
I went with a party of four for a business dinner
We had the 8 course tasting menu with wine pairing
Each course was accompanied by a new bottle of wine
Both the food and the wines were extraordinary
Very flavorful dishes with excellent wines to match
The service was top notch -- better than I expected
My favorite date spot to impress a girl
The wait staff are like best butlers, who can tastefully make you feel like a million bucks
Great loaction
What can beat the upper east side townhouse?  The food is amazing
Try DB Modern too

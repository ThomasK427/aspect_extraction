Between the food and the ambiance, it's my favorite place for a relaxed date
I've been here many times over the years, and I've never been disappointed
Service is always gracious, food is excellent, comfortable atmosphere, and prices are decent
I highly recommend the Thai dumplings and any of the duck entrees
I was turned onto this small neighborhood place by my boyfriend who spent many years living in Thailand
The food is authentic, well prepared with fresh ingredients, and delicious
The prices are moderate and well worth it (lunch specials are so cheap!)
I highly recommend the summer rolls, the pad thai (which typically is a boring staple
but not here), and the deep fried crispy fish (both varieties
with chili sauce or sweet/source sauce are great)
The waitstaff is soft spoken but attentive and very sweet
A definite GO!
my friend and I were visiting New York first time and cravying for some Thai Food
This restaurant was by far the worse choices we made in New York
We had Tom Yum and deep fried tofu for appertizers
The Tom Yum soup was cold so we asked to be reheated
Witress wasn't listening just gave us a chilli pepper to make it spicy
We also tried the Thai chicken basil eggplants and yellow curry chicken
Eggplants was not bad but oily
However, their curry chicken doesn't taste curry but watery
Overall, not recommended
The food here was pretty mediocore
I think the Cuban/Chinese restraunt down the street would have been more adventurous
My friend and I were craving some Tom Yum soup and what we got was a cold and bland soup; not even close
The curry was also pretty bland but it probably was made that way to suite mid-western pallates
The only reedeming dish was the eggplant
I have tried many Thai restaurants in both NY and NJ and this I must say is the best by far
There menu may not be large, but they will make a special dish if you like a certain entree
I was told that on Friday and Saturday evernings they are packed so I would call ahead now if you have not before
Mouth watering, lick the plate delicious
Best place to go for lunch
The prices are moderate
Good service
This place was wonderful
Clean
Romantic
Great food
The hosts were wonderful
They seated us immediately and then moved us when we requested a table away from the kitchen
The masaman curry was excellent as was the tom khom (sp?) soup
The portions were big, and the vegetable tasted fresh
An excellent restaurant from top to bottom
I liked the down-key, welcoming atmosphere (no loud music to shout over, no pretense or exclusivity)
The bathroom didn't give me the creeps and overall the restaurant seemed neat and clean (tableware smelled fresh from the laundry - kind of endearing)
I had the vegetable green curry - which was excellent (the tofu wasn't fried and the mushrooms were actually fresh)
The Scene Babbo sits in a charming two-level Waverly Place townhouse
The room is invitingly decorated with warm yellow walls, glowing sconces, heavy mirrors and tan banquettes--all making for a spare, modern elegance
A small and festive bar sits near the entrance, along with a handful of tables set aside for patrons who lack reservations
The Food Over-the-top Italian food that isn't for the faint of heart
No other Italian restaurant in Manhattan achieves the same explosiveness of flavor--as in ravioli stuffed with beef cheeks, crushed squab liver and black truffles, or a salad of greens, chanterelle mushrooms and Pecorino cheese layered with a barely cooked egg and lamb's tongue vinaigrette
Desserts take a light, but no less flavorful, tact: Try the saffron panna cotta, with poached quince and pink peppercorns
I was super excited to come here and picked Babbo out of the many NY restaurants
We couldn't try the tasting menu b/c we were both way too full from lunch and had a small appetite, which was very disappointing
However, our server was extremely helpful and gave some great advice on their menu
We shared the grilled octopus and the mint's love letter
The octopus was too salty but once you get used to that, it was quite tasty with the sauce
The mint ravioli was very good, but my boyfriend thought it was too minty and overwhelming
I had the duck and the portion was very big
It was very good but didn't 'wow' me
The striped bass that my boyfriend had didn't have much taste
Overall, we enjoyed the ambience and the service
The food was alright and nothing spectacular
The value , was actually really good given the price range for other fine-dining restaurants
Unfortunately we were too full to have their desserts, but did have the complimentary cookies that they gave

Some simple logic
When a place is in high demand
guess what? You're not just going to be able to walk in there and be seated right away
And so what if you have to reserve one month in advance? You should be happy to be dining in a place so sought after
2
The music is not elevator music, (Thank God, that's all this city needs, another blah-blah, boring restaurant)
But if you thought that the music was too loud you must live in a monastery
3
Just because you're paying a lot of money does not mean people have to kneel at your feet
Front-of-house has a job to do and its first priority is to the people who have been waiting a full month for their reservation
4
The food almost literally speaks for itself
I can't do it justice here
It is a pure delight
5
The service was a-m-a-z-i-n-g
We had the most patient, informed waiter I have ever come across
He happily answered our barrage of questions covering the entire menu
We had a great sommelier who advised us on a wonderful desert and desert wine pairing
Our reservation was at 8 oclock, we finished up at 10:10pm without rush
6
Babbo has an upstairs and a downstairs
I would recommend upstairs for an 8 oclock seating, this because of the sky-light
You will begin your meal in daylight and end it in candle-light with a beautiful view of the stars above you
Truly a great experience
Visited Babbo to celebrate a birthday on the fly; first time w/out a reservation
Walked in around 6:45pm and waited about 10 mins for a table in the bar area (Although the walk-in tables are in a high traffic area, it's also prime real estate for people watching in addition to dining)
Since there was a vegetarian amongst us, the waitress was very helpful in explaining all the options available and made outstanding suggestions in addition to answering any questions (roman artichokes, caprese, sweet potato lunes goat cheese tortellini were table favs)
We were very happy with every single course ordered and the wine suggested by the sommelier was excellent as well
Desserts were a wonderful cap to the experience (strawberry gelato was absolutely amazing honey and ricotta dipping sauce for zeppolinis was superb)
Yet another one of many intensely satisfying meals here
We were lucky enough to get in on the fourth of July due to a cancellation
Whoever couldnt make it there that day
thank you thank you thank you!  Our entire table went with the traditional tasting menu with the reserve wines
amazing! It seemed that with every course someone at the table would say this is the best one yet

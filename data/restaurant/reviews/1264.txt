Even as a stranger, the service at the bar was excellent as was the wait staff who continuously checked back to see if I was okay while waiting for my party
The food is exceptional, as are the desserts which are all created by Heather, while Scott oversees the kitchen's menu
I'd go back in New York Minute
The food was decent, nothing special
The $11 salad was unbelievably small
It's a tiny place, with no special decor
Entrees approaching $30 are entirely unjustified
It is always nice to see quality restaurants appear on the Upper East Side--after four years in the neighborhood we get tired of always going downtown for good food
But while the space is lovely, the staff is very friendly, and there are some nice dishes, the bill at Spigolo is about 20% higher than it should be given the quality/alternatives
The grilled strip was fine (and came with unique potato creations) but the grilled salmon was truly mediocre; the pasta was very oily, and the arugula/orange salad was overly simple (for $11)
I hope that Spigolo stays open and am thrilled that it seems to be busy often, but we wont be quite won over until the owners can make the quality match the prices (or vice versa)
As stated in a previous review, it definitely does not [yet] deserve a 26 from Zagat!
I loved Spigolo
The food was terrific
From the beet salad to the gnocchi, which were light and airy and melted in your monuth
The steak was a winner as was the lamb shank special
And the desserts were all winners
The serice is very attentive and it is clear from the first encounter when making the reservation to the actual experience that this staff was trained by Danny Meyers
I think the prices could be a touch lower for a trattoria dining experience but considering the level of food and service- I would certainly go back!
This is a lovely place with good food and great service
But the prices are getting a bit too high for the typle of restaurant that it is
I made the mistake of ordering the lamb special -- come on -- $36 for a couple of lamb chops? But otherwise, I recommend it -- next time I'll be sure to ask prices before ordering!
We were able to make last minute reservation @ Spigolo
They were very friendly, but food was horriable
ZAGAT was wrong
They do not deserve 26
More likely 20 would be more accurate
We had special lobster ravioli and it was very cheesy salty
Luckily there were only 5 small pieces
Ordered veal risotto for the main and it was VERRRRY salty
I was able to have only 4 bites
Had very disappointed experience tonight
However, service was great
We recently ate at the bar
The crowd was social but mature, the bartender was really nice and everything we ate was delicious
The dessert was amazing
We were even able to call in advance to make sure there was space at the bar because I was on crutches and the owner reserved the seats til we got there
She was lovely
This is one of the best restaurants on the upper east side
Friendly and helpful wait staff, excellent food, great ambiance
Need to make reservations in advance
This location has been unlucky for years, but Spigolo has definitely broken the curse! Salmon Tartare is delicious as are all the appetizers
Lemon fetuccini with grilled shrimp + arugula pesto was sublime! Fish specials tend to be exceptional, especially baramundi
Desserts are way beyond the standard tiramisu
Interesting, well-priced regional wine list
The food was outstanding from start to finish
The polenta side dish was outrageous and I normally hate polenta
The chicken, veal and lamb dishes were all excellent and the rhubarb cobbler for dessert is to die for! The service was wonderful - very warm and attentive
Only negative was that it was very loud when we got there (at 7pm) but as dinner progressed it got quieter
Spigolo is just what the Upper Eastside needed -- a divine eating experience, excellent service and a nice atmosphere
The menu is unique without being trendy and the food is fantastic
This small new restaurant is worth trying
We had to wait for 20 minutes after arriving early for our reservation, but the waitstaff was very friendly (the pastry chef doubles as a hostess!)
Loved the tuna tartare appetizer, hake fish entree, but not crazy about the gnocchi (a bit mushy and grainy)
Reasonable bottles of wine and great dessert
The Scene Inside its seven-foot-wide confines, sunny, painted-brick walls and wood-and-copper fixtures keep things homey and neat
And while a narrow wood counter and three stools provide desperation seating, most folks choose to take lunch and dinner to go
The Food While several of the northern Indian specialties remain on the menu perenially, including the parathas and flavored lassis, most of the main-course dishes change daily
That means you'll have to call ahead or drop by to see if the shahi chicken, dark meat roasted with cilantro and ground nuts, slow-cooked cardamom-laced eggplant, or the tender lamb stew in a heavenly gravy are on the day's chalkboard menu
An order of the goat- or daikon-filled paratha (warm pancake-like flatbreads) and a mango or cardamom lassi (the yogurt-based drink the restaurant is named for) round out a perfectly pleasant, picnic-ready meal
Don't even think of eating in unless you fancy having yuppies wack you in the back with their handbags as they swish in
Food
nothing to write home about
The lassi's however are outstanding
Initially I was deeply dissapointed with the serving size (about the size of a small bodga coffee) and the price (nearly $4) for the small lassi but found that it was so rich that even shared between two people it was almost too much
Worth it as an occasional treat
can't eat there but they now deliver
The only negative would be a very limited menu selection, especially since the food is very good and you want to go more often
This is a cheap and very good Indian place
I recommend you to ask for delivery or take out
The place is too small, but the food is good and cheap if you know what to order (go easy on the Lassis, they are $5 each)
we found the food to be sub-par, overpriced, and cheap quantities
extremely dissapointing
In Short The narrow space features a long countertop, round metal tables and a raised retro-styled couch lit by hanging spotlights
The made-to-order sandwiches--steak, free-range chicken, portobello and eggplant, and burgers--come "Plain Jane" or dressed up with toppings like avocado, chipotle pepper and mango chutney
Salads are prepared with a variety of ingredients, and sides include fries and battered green beans
The menu takes a tropical turn with shakes made of fresh papaya, passion fruit and the like
i've been here 3 times over the past year, each time forgetting how truly disappointing the previous visit had been
I ordered 2 steak sandwiches with fries to go and patiently waited 20 minutes
I would have left if i hadn't already paid $28
I ordered the steaks medium - they were overly well-done, dry as a bone, as were the fries
the steak was pitifully small, barely seasoned, there was hardly any cheese on it, and no lettuce or tomato that comes when you eat-in
waaaaay overrated, way too expensive, terrible
I love their sandwiches! It seems like it would be healthier but they are a little bit greasy, which kind of sucks, but they are delicious! It would be nice if they had some healthy alternatives to some of the fried stuff etc
, and if the prices were a little bit lower (it's like 8 bucks for a sandwich)
Overall the sandwiches are AWESOME
just wish the menu had a few different choices and the food was slightly less greasy (because this place of all places has potential to be a bit healthier than others)
Stopped at Zozo's after reading that the pastry chef makes her own gelati for the restaurant
The selection of handmade ice cream was delicious, but it was NOT gelato, if you are looking for the type of gelato you actually get in Italy
However, the ice cream and particularly the sorbets were WONDERFUL in their own right - delicious and highly recommended
We were delighted with zozos as they hasd great sirloin steaks delicious chicken breast sandwiches , the salads were well done and the shakes were excellent
I would highly recommend for a fantastic meal
Great sandwiches like filet mignon and sirloin
Lots of super side dishes
Accidentally found the place while LES shopping
Hope they get outdoor seating soon
I've been to ZoZo's several times now and have had exceptional food and service (cute staff) each time
Based on what I've tried, the truffled chicken salad sandwich, the burger (with avacado and chipotle!), the design your own salads, and the filet mignon sandwiches are not to be missed
I highly recommend the fresh strawberry shake with milk and the buttermilk battered green beans are such a great alternative to fries (although their fries rock too)! The atmosphere is right for that part of town and the design and layout of the store is really unique
You have to wait a little longer to get your food, but that's because this place is FRESH and made to order

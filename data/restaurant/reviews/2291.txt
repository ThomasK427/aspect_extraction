I usually stay away from places that alway get a lot of publicity,usually it means
overrated
What a wonderful surprise when my husband and I went for dinner last friday 10/8/2003
We were greeted in such a friendly and pleasant manner (the french accent made us forget we were in NY) Our dinner was fantastic with unsurpassable service
We asked many questions and our waiter was well informed
We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of wine which the maitre'd selected
We ended our meal with an outrageous dessert and complimentary macaroons
It was the best dining experience ever, from the service to the food EXCELLENT
We've been upper east siders for several years now and have frequented this establishment for dessert and easy access to pretty good breakfast croissants
The service was consistently inattentive, inefficient and rude, but we overlooked this because of our intentional limited interaction
Our most recent visit was the most aweful experience
We patiently waited for 20 mins
until the maitre 'd finally acknowledged our presence
We requested for a two-seater, among several available, and he responded very rudely, while munching on a crumbly snack that there were no tables available
This is the first time in our lives, as successful professionals and paying customers, that we have ever been treated so rudely
The pastries are good
but not THAT good
I can compare dining at Payard to fine dining at any French bistro in Paris
I had lunch off the prefix menu and for $28
00 to start I had a wonderful fall salad with roasted pears and goat cheese
My entre choice was a braised duck that was so tender it melted my mouth and I picked for my dessert a pear crme bloule which was outstanding
Here is wonderful authentic French dining; did I mention the delicious crusty bread? Payard is an incredibly charming for a date or an evening out with friends
I've yet to dine at Payard but their desserts are very delicious
The only things that's on the downside is the service - not the friendliest nor very accomodating
As a dessert connoisseur, I feel that their pastry is mainly about having a fancy appearance
The taste is good, but nothing I'd describe as sublime
As a diner who seeks out the best talent France has to offer in our kitchens, I am constantly amazed and delighted that Payard still delivers each and everytime I dine there
The food, service and ambiance make it one of the best places in NYC from a full dining experience to just getting a coffee and croissant in the morning
I cannot recommend this little bit of Paris in NY enough!
I really like the food here, and have been to the restaurant several times, but the manager and hostess are inevitably VERY rude
For some reason the rest of the waitstaff is fabulous so they help make up a bit for their supervisors
Which is good
If it weren't for them, I'd never go back to the place
Decent food does not make up for rude service
My husband and I celebrated my birthday here and the service was superb
We were escorted to our seats right away and the food was very good not to mention the birthday cake and the desserts we took home from the shop in front
I come here each time I have a visitor in the City and splurge on the best pastries and cakes I have ever tasted
Yes, the pastry was perfect- go just for dessert-, and the service was outstanding, but I dont know what happened to the food! The first course of scallops and caviar coupled with celery seemed very bland and left me totally under whelmed; the immense use of oil, coupled with the over cooked vegetables, left my fish entre inedible
What a damper on what should have been a lovely meal
At least dessert was fabulous!
had dinner there about a month ago
we got the tasting menu
food was well executed
no surprises or misses
wine list is very reasonable
got a bottle of excellent chateauneuf du pape
dessert of course was the best part of the meal
the restaurant has a nice casual yet sophisticated feel
it was very comfortable, nice date place
if i lived in the neighborhood i'd pick up pastries more often
i must admit, the desserts at payard were extremely heavenly, but i the service was the worst i have ever encountered
the people working in the pastry section of the restaurant were rude and not very helpful
its almost like they expected everyone who walked in the door to be completely familiar with the restaurant and pastries
they made faces when i asked questions, which made me very angry and extremely uncomfortable
On my first visit to New York City, I chose Payard Bistro for no reason other than the Deserts
We arrived for our 8:00PM reservation 10 minutes late on a Friday night
They were extremly busy and we were seated 5 minutes after arriving
We decided to order the tasting menu and it was wonderful
They explained each course in detail
The MaitreD was great and our waiter could not have been better
I would highly recommend this restaurant and will be back
The only con was that the tables were a little too close together for me!
Payard has the BEST restaurant desserts in the city, there is no contest
The food is decent but not spectacular
The front area's cafe selections are a matter of personal taste (I find the croissants to be too heavy but the brioche perfect)
The restaurant desserts, however, are the kind that you cannot help but keep taking another bite until you've finished the whole thing
Payard has taken the enjoyment of dessert to an extraordinary level
The food is very good, served in a handsome dining room
But it is hard to enjoy a meal when the snotty maitre d
claims never to have heard of your two-week old reservation (confirmed that morning), leaves the table for three you ordered vacant until the arrival of more important customers, and exiles you to an empty part of the restaurant upstairs
The food was great but the server was not nice and even rude at times
The desserts were amazing! It was worth the price!!! We even saw Dr
Ruth there!
Amazing food, service, especially chocolates and dessert
We were well taken care of, and each time we come, we totally enjoy the experience
Always, consistent, excellent food and service
Would definitely recommend it
I have been in Payard for years and tried many of its desserts and cookies
All I had tasted are so excellent: fresh ingredients and fantastic looks
What impresses me most is the consistence of high quality
You won't be disappointed! BTW, I absolutely agree some (not all) waiters' attitude is not friendly at all
Well, that part is very consistent too
in two occasions when i took my family and friends (5-6 persons) to payard patisserie, the coffee shop, and we asked for a table for 5 or 6 they said we dont have it and that's that
They let us wait for 1/2 hour! I am wondering howcome a high rated! coffee shop can not provide a table for 5-6
The second time the manager was so rude, unprofessional, and insulting that we had to leave the coffee shop
because first we ask for a table for 5 and then when we saw a table for 3, 3 of us sat down and the manager was telling us that you can not do this! what kind of high class restaurant does this! they dont care for the customers
I had taken a lot of people there but because of their unprofessionalism i am not taking anybody there anymore
Love this place for morning coffee and croissants--sitting at the counter with a fresh, flaky, buttery croissant and a dab of raspberry jam is the best way to start the day, surrounded by French speakers and impeccably dressed Upper East Side ladies
The strawberry tarts are marvellous too
Sedutto has the best ice cream that I've ever tasted in NY
It has a very rich taste similar to a Dairy Queen's and they are very generous with the portions and toppings
I highly recommend going there on a hot night for some cold great tasting ice cream
Easy to get to and great in a pinch
Yummy froaen treats
I've tried to overlook this joint's faults, but I'm giving up
The soups and salads are usually fine, but the value for your money is very poor
When a typical soup and salad combo costs $9, you'd better get somthing fantastic -- and it's often not
And what's up with charging 25 cents extra for a piece of bread at these prices?! Furthermore, getting your salad made can be a disaster -- the staff is very slow, and they don't always pay attention (I wound up with carrot dressing instead of French dressing today)
Maybe this single location just happens to be the let-down of the chain
I'm going to go to Pret a Manger next door from now on

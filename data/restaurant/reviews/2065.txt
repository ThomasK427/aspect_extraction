This is a reall drinking Pub! Just the right music, atmosphere and attractive staff
I loved my burger and beer
Great with a group of freinds
I HAD A GREAT TIME HERE
I LOVED THE LARGE BEER SELECTION AND THE PUB STYLE FOOD
LOTS OF WOOD WORK AND REALLY COZY
IT HAS THREE FIREPLACES AND GREAT OLD PUB DECORATIONS
I WILL GO BACK SOON
I love the staff! Very friendly
I was there for hours drinking New Castle Brown Ale and eating chicken wings and burgers
Great music and comfortable atmosphere
We had a great time here
Great beer from all over and a really cozy old puib like atmosphere
A lot of wood work and brick
The staff was very freindly
I could sit there for hours
They also had great music playing
Definately some of the best service I have had in the city, At least with out spending way too much money
And might I say the girls working our table were gorgeous, which makes it even better
I highly recommend it
where it's cool because you know the people there; no beef
Got there around 12:30 last night
The bartenders were all nice and we got served right away, no waiting for you to get their attention, no attitude
I ordered a Transformation (4 types of rum and 4 types of juice) -- pretty strong, I couldn't tell if there was actually juice in it! Not bad for $8
I used to love going to this place
Me and my buddies always had a great time, great drinks and great atmosphere But what happened to the female manager i think her name was Kelly? She was the best and always made sure we had an excelent time! Bring Back Kelly!!!
Have you seen a movie American werewolf in London? Do you remember that old pub in the beginning of this movie? That is the one that you now can visit in NY
Food is OK, prices are average, and beer is good everywhere
OK to go for experience
Junnos is a good place to visit when you are looking for a quiet drink with a friend
You will find a winning combination of music, people and drinks
In addition, the owner is community minded and these are the kind of businesses I love to support
I tried this place when it first opened about 2- 3 years ago and was won over by it's modern Asian/Japanese menu and cocktail selection
I just went back with some friends last night and I'm sad to report that the quality of the food had really slipped, even though the drinks and the atmosphere were as nice as ever
The shrimp ravioli was bland and tough, and the maki tasted like it had been prepared way earlier in the day
It's a nice place to hang out if you're in the neighborhood but they're going to have to fix what's going on in the kitchen for me to eat there again
The Scene It's modeled after the great matriarchal Mexican home kitchens of yore, though it's unlikely any home kitchen ever got this crowded
Fortunately, the efficient and cheerful servers handle throngs of hungry customers with ease, creating a mood that's as sunny as the warm, yellow decor
The Food The influence of elderly female relatives also looms over the menu, as in a snail recipe that was inspired by a "Grand Aunt" and a judiciously-spiced mole poblano handed down from a grandmother
Even a nun named Brigida from "the convent of Coyoacan" gets into the act--the guacamole bears her blessing
Everything about the food is fresh and lively
The guacamole tastes as green as it looks, and the light cream sauce on the grilled chicken is delicate without seeming dull
MY friend and I were waiting for a warm day to try this restaurant since it's known for it's outside seating
Luckily, a sunny day in April seemed perfect
We sat outside, made it for happy hour, and had an axcellent meal
A little pricy, but worth it
We compare all Mexican restaurants to this one now
WOW- I love Mexican food and this place is great! The decor makes it seem as though you are in another city but the food is totally perfect
Great for large groups or a place to take the parents - not at all a scene
We love Mi Cocina
It is probably the best Mexican food I have ever had
It is authentic food, not tex mex, with really fresh and wholesome ingredients
my girlfriend is celiac and they went through all the ingredients in detail of the food - it is really fresh and made with original ingredients
It is not an exciting NYC scene like Dos Caminos, for example, but that suits us fine
It's not cheap, but totally worth it
Its about time I found authentic Mexican Food in the city
Coming from San Diego/Tijuana, I am know what real Mexican cuisine should taste like
On Friday, we ordered an amazing dish called Cochinita Pibil which is an authentic Yucatecan dish that takes about 10 hrs to marinade
The dish was unbelievable! It was the perfect blend of spices and flavor---not too overpowering
Another dish highly recommended is the Pollo en Adobada--slightly spicy but delicious! It was definetely the best Mex food I have had in the city! Plus, the service was excellent and speedy--our waiter was Angel from Guadalajara, Mexico
We've started coming here about once a week since April, because a margarita in the sun is hard to resist, and Mi Cocina has the best
The food is all excellent and made with high-quality ingredients
It's expensive, but they're not cutting any corners on quality so I'll pay
We've never had a problem with the service, in fact they've never been anything but polite
I've even sent food back when brought the wrong meal and they gave me nothing but an apology
They certainly didn't charge me for it
A table next to ours once had the wrong item on their check, but the waitstaff fixed the error without argument
OK, it's true that Mi Cocina ain't cheap, but that's only b/c we've gotten used to paying for Taco Bel* when we want Mexican food
This place is really, really good for New York City and it's not nearly as expensive as the snootier El C*d
The food is extremely well made [kickASS tamales!!!] and fairly healthy, the margaritas are strong and well mixed
When you mix in the lovely atmosphere, the prices aren't too bad
[$60 for two]
I have searched Manhattan over for a decent margarita and this place has the best I've found so far
The best is the on-the-rocks margarita made with Grand Marnier is the best with the standard blended drinks being a good stand-by
Although the restaurant isn't on a super busy street the outside seating is fun in the spring and summertime for people watching
Also, if there's room they will let you have drinks in the tiny garder space in the back
What can we say - - - it' been around for years and it's a place we always seem to forget, but when we do go, it's always a treat
Food is wonderful and the ambiance is wonderful
Good margeritas too!!! Lots of tequila choices
Friendly waitstaff too
Great outdoor garden
Try the tortilla soup,enchiladas and the great chips and salsa
After so many Americanized Mexican meals, I was thrilled to find authentic Mexican in a friendly neighborhood restaurant
My favorites are the camarones en pipian and various mole dishes
The maragaritas are great, but I prefer one of their great selection of tequilas or after-dinner liquors like the Xtabentun; if you remember tequila only from your college days, get ready for a completely different taste
The relatively new garden offers a romantic setting as compared to the more exuberant indoors
Sure its a little more pricey than most Mexican places, but it ain't Burritoville either: you get what you pay for
while the food is solid and the room very nice, the service is not professional and the prices are sky high
While the majority of Mexican restaurants in New York offer the Americanized Mexican foods, it was a pleasant surprise to find a authentic mexican cuisine in this restaurant
We had Caracoles and Ceviche as appetizer, Chile en Nogada and Huachinango Veracruzano as main dish, and Coconut Flan as dessert
Everything was wonderful
Staff are friendly and service is very attentive
If you are aficionados of Mexican food, you should not miss it
not sure what happened with the city search critiquer, but there was nothing wrong with our service
our waiter was polite without being snobby and we joked with the hostess a little
the food was awesome
i had the marinated skirt steak, which was great (which came with tortillas), and my girlfriend loved her peach margherita
they deserve their top 2 ranking mexican restaurant by city search, and top 5 ranking in the mexican food area by zagats
highly recommended
Sure, the food is great

Barista pulled a second shot when the first was 'long' without being asked
A true artist and professional)
As a former European, I have never experienced coffee this good stateside
Europe just got a little closer again! Great great coffee, a daily treat!
Unbelievable flavor and the prices are lower than Starbucks
This is what real espresso, capuccino and latte should taste like
You can count on getting just the same excellent flavor every time you go there
Midtown needs a place like this
Thanks, Zibetto!
Fantastic Espresso bar! The real thing! Have not had this god coffe ever in the US
Reminds me off my local italian coffe bar in Faenza
The paninis are superb the coffe out of this world - thanks Zibetto!
Amazing! Finally world class espresso in NY
Feels like youre in Italy
Highly reccomend for espresso lovers
dinner last night ,had the duck and it just was amazing with the coffe ,also had the mussel salad with a pea soup chill that was different but good ,the food here is just great and you have to thing about what you eat ,and our waitress told us you have to eat a bit of every thing to gether to understand the reason behind the chefs food and she was right
i cant wait to go back ,and do the tasting ,asi work in the industry as ,i think this place is like a little find ,its got every thing the food just tops every thing great wine list cant wait to come back and do the chefs menu see ye soon knife and fork
The food was great, the staff was so much fun and the flavours! where does he come up with these?! This resturant is for foodies - coffee with duck, star anised vension, and the cheese plate was to die for!! We did the tasting menu - man thats lot of food
I had to run around the block a few times! The portions were great, hotel coste was the music when I was there, not the chef like some peolpe say
He even came to my table checked if everything was ok
I am a bucther and his cooking was just right the meat was nice and tender and full of flavour
He's just a kid but this kid can cook! Well knife and fork, can't wait till we're back down here
I went to Knife and Fork recently
My friend and I had been trying to a get reservation on the weekend but could not due to it's popularity
We finally got a table at 6:00pm on a Monday night and thought we'd enjoy a early dinner
Of course the place was empty but that I didn't mind
Having heard before hand that service was sometimes slow we figured the chef won't have as many dishes to prepare as we were the first to be seated
On to the meal
On paper the menu looks nice
In reality it was the worst meal at a restaurant I have ever had
EVER
We opted for the chefs tasting menu and can only surmise that he didn't taste it before he sent it out
It started out promising with the scallops and went down hill from then on
By the end we were spitting the food in our napkins because we were too embarassed to tell the server how bad it was
She was kind and wasn't the blame for this debacle
The monk fish with a peppercorn crust was a like a flavorless fish nugget overpowered with a beach sand textured peppercorn dust
Terrible
The stuffed quail leg, dry and brittle
The worse was supposedly escargo and porriage
It was more like slugs and oatmeal
The vinison was dry and the other dishes were so bad I can't remember them
The cheese platter at the end was pathetic
I'm actually glad there were small portions because otherwise I wouldn't have had any place to discard/hide what I couldn't eat
Which was pretty much everything
To survive in this NYC restaurant market repeat customers and recommendationsfrom satisfied are a must
I'll never go back to this place
Not even if some one else was paying for it
I'll never recommend it to anyone I would consider a friend
Sorry, but to all who are giving this place rave reviews, you must have been in a different restaurant than I
After paying $186 (for 2 including 2 beers and a bottle for wine) for this unsatifactory meal I feel the need to tell it like it really was
I took my date here for his birthday, and the ambiance is very intimate and relaxing
We sat at the highly recommended corner booth, and had a nice view of the restaurant, kitchen, bar, and the street
Our waitress was so friendly and welcoming, and took the time to explain each dish that was served
We got the prix fixed menu, and the chef created tasty and diverse dishes for us with all sorts of meats and veggies
We had a lovely dining experience, were treated very warmly, and I felt that the high bill was well worth it!
We had the tasting menu which sounded delightful on paper but fell short on execution
The food was actually pretty tasty but most dishes were cold
Wait time for food was VERY LONG and I had lots of chances to observe why as I waited and waited
there is ONE chef preparing ALL OF THE DISHES from start to finish
Prep,cooking and plating
ONE other guy in the kitchen who ONLY washes dishes
RIDICULOUS!!! This is why --yes, it is true -- you CAN hear the chef swearing on many an occasion (as many others here have noted
) If they get some HELP IN THERE this place would have a chance
Otherwise, NO WAY
NY'ers NOT gonna tolerate this kind of service
This is one of my favorite spots! I have been several times with different friends and always had a great time
The menu changes everytime we go and always has something interesting and inventive on it
The 6 course tasting menu for $45 is a bargain by any standards! The wine list is diverse with several excellent options under $50
the staff is warm and welcoming, combined with the cozy atmosphere it is a refreshing change from the pretentious environments that usually serve this quality food
As the chef is alone in the kitchen, there sometimes can be a wait, but if you like the people you are with and don't have anywhere you need to be it is a great atmosphere for a long, relaxing meal taking in all of the flavors and nicely pacing the 6 courses so you don't get too full and can enjoy the food! I can see how it wouldn't be for everyone, but if you want something different with exceptional quality and a comfortable friendly atmosphere, this place is a must try!
This was a delightful little restaurant
It reminds me of leisurely dining in France where the menus are always seasonal
The freshness of the ingredients came out in the flavors
Vegtables actually tasted like the vegtables they are instead of bland preservative mush
The chef does have some crutch flavors that show up in all the dishes so it's not the kind of place you will want to eat everyday
My friend felt the flavors were over-layered, perhaps due to the french/morrocan/eastern european influences
The portions are correctly sized for multi-course dining so you should expect indulge in more than one course
They don't rush your meal, but let you linger for wine and conversation
If you're a beer belly-type guy who normally inhales their dinner in 5 minutes at TGIFridays, this isn't your place
And it's not appropriate for families, (but then, maybe folks with kids would be happier in the suburbs or Brooklyn)
In all, I found it an enjoyable spot, but only for folks with a european frame of mind towards dining
Please don't bring any date nor children because there is bad energy and the chef is cursing loud like he doesn't care if the dinning room hears it
Overprize
In this tiny, but airy place, I had a memorable birthday dinner
Some of the dishes were exceptional, but what really made the place stand out was the vibe and friendliness of the staff
The table next to us was getting ready to leave, and offered us their unfinished bottle of wine
We started chatting with them, and told them it was my birthday
The server overheard this, and immediately produced four glasses of champagne - for me, my boyfriend, and for the table next to us! He said it was compliments of the chef to celebrate my birthday
Amazing! We did not do the tasting menu, but ordered starters and mains
The cured salmon starter was the standandout, as was the tomato tea consume (a complimentary amuse bouche)
The menu and food was more gamey than I had hoped (menu for the night had venison, duck, lamb) - this isn't a disparagement, I just happen to not gravitate towards gamey food
But the night was completely fun and memorable!!
The week's wait for a table was well worth it
The presentation was seamless and steady; we were fawned on by two waitresses who seemed genuinely interested in ensuring the experience was engaging and enjoyable
Each dish on the tasting menu was delicious, including the rich and buttery foie gras, which we were unable to finish due to the surfacing of conscience mid-course (google 'Foie gras: Delicacy of Despair' for more details)
Seconds after we permitted our half-eaten fattened goose livers to be whisked away, our waitress materialized, bearing two cold drinks and the chef's profound apologies for the dish - a completely unneccessary but vastly appreciated gesture
The dessert, a mint chocolate mousse, would have been the perfect countermeasure for the summer heat, but we were allowed to linger so long over our courtesy cocktails that by the time we sailed out the door with stomachs pleasingly full, the temperature had fallen drastically and our dinner was a distant but lovely memory
My experience at Knife Fork was one that I will never forget
The nightmare began with the bewildered look on the hostess' face when we asked about our confirmed reservation
Huh, um, um was their witty response

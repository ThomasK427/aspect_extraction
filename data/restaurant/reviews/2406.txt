Deserts are affordable, but only for few menues
I tried to get into serendipity on two weekday nights, only to wait over 45 minutes each time
The first time, we left, but the second time, we hung around
It seemed cramped with little room to breathe, like they were trying to pack in the customers
The service was ok, despite fouling up my order
The prices were outrageous, especially for the frrozen hot chocolate, which seemed like something i could make at home
I wouldn't go back again
It's more than serendipity to find such a charming place like this in the city
I had a lazy lunch on a weekday with my sister and there was no need for reservations as we got seated right away in a booth
My turkey and Brie on a baguette with sprouts was a nice light fare because I'm saving room for the notoriously famous Frozen Hot Chocolate
The moment of truth comes and I was reduced to a satiated puddle of bliss on first sip
Chocolatey nirvana in a considerably large cup
You can share one serving or if you're too greedy, bare your fangs if an extra straw is dunking in without your permission
Over priced, poor quality ice cream but veddy, veddy yuppy
I am from the west coast and first saw Serendipity 3 on the movie Serendipity
Ever since then I knew I would just have to go there when I finally made it to New York
It is a very unique spot, and although somewhat isolated, VERY busy
Expect to wait if you are unable to get a reservation, and if you can
Keep It! That's a pretty rare thing according to our hotels concierge
Overall, the food was good, and the environment is very cute, and one of a kind
I love Serendipty 3, it is a great place for a GREAT dessert!
This is an unique place to visit, but the food is nothing special
Great service though
I dont know who said the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate taste like Ovaltine
The need their taste buds examined
I dream about their Frrrozen Hot Chocolate! Excellent place
The long line isn't fun, but stick it out
I must admit that this place has one of my very favorite desserts and it is called the Forbiden Broadway Sundae, but it is hard to take the attitude that comes with it
The wait is always horrible unless you go on a weeknight and the service is usually below par
The food is way overpriced and not good, but the desserts are to die for and this is why this place is still going strong
Everyone should go once esp if you have a sweet tooth!
It has great frozen Hot Chocolateand other desserts
It's worth the long wait
Went for the frozen hot chocolate
It was just ok
tasted like a chocolate milkshake
There are better places in NYC
The main course food was not very good
However; all desserts are amazing with huge portions
One shoudl be prepared for at least a 30-60 minute wait between the hours of 6 - 10pm
I just moved to New York from Texas about three months ago, and of all the great places I've experienced in the city, Serendipity is my FAVORITE!! I love it!! The atmosphere and desserts are to die for!! This is a great, romantic place for a date too!!  The frozen hot chocolate is their signature, but their sundaes are also AMAZING!
This place is a MUST for dessert lovers - the prices are cheap but the portions are fairly large - most desserts can be split amongst 2 people, but be ware that there is a $5 min
charge per person
The host is not very friendly, and be prepared to wait if you do not have a reservation (I recommend making one if possible)
The place is semi romantic, and attracts a lot of tourist on weekends
NYers should go there during the weekday to avoid the crowds
Best ice cream sundae's ever! Skip the popular 'frozen hot chocolate' and go straight for a hot fudge sundae with peanut butter on it and you won't be sorry
Great place to bring visitors or kids
Wait can be loooong though
You may have to wait for a while to get a table, but it's worth it, even if you're just there for dessert
And if you're there for a whole meal, be sure to save room for ice cream
I have three words
FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE
-Enough said
It's not a dinner place, I'll tell you that
go for DESSERT AND DESSERT ONLY!
Since this place is so famous, I decided to try it out, there's so many people, and we had to wait 1 and 1/2 hour
When we finally seated, we have to wait again for another 20 min until the waiter come, he was not a very pleasant waiter, didnt smile, was just doing his job writing food and very snobby
The food was good, I ordered omelette, it was huge, I ordered frozen hot chocolate
I didnt understand why everyone is talking about this chocolate thingy since the taste is like ovaltine mixed with ice, some milk or some cream, with a whipped cream in the middle
That's about it
Btw, the price is ridiculous, what kind of an ice cream would be prized at 10 dollar??!!
If you want a cold, and sweet treat, then this is the place to go
Famous for the frozen hot chocolate
The Sundays are built for a crowd or a voracious appetite
They told us it was a ten minute wait, one hour later we were seated
We ordered one hamburger and one hot dog and one desert to split between us
Thirty minutes later they brought our dessert which tasted like Ovaltine or Alba 77 blended with ice
Fifteen minutes later I asked for the check and was given a shocked look and asked don't you want your meal? I replied no and about ten minutes later they brought my meal but no check
It is amazing to me that this place thrives if this is the way they do business
I reas about this place on your web site before I left San Diego
I warn others this place is not worth it
If you do decide to brave it stay away from the waiter with the mohawk
He should be behind a desk crunching numbers, far from the public
We went to Serendipity on Labor Day and it was packed so we had to wait
I did not have a problem with this what I had a problem with was the horrible attitude from the staff at the hostess station
There were four or five different people working the station and everyone was more obnoxious than the next
I understand that this place is popular but it was apparent that they did not care if you stayed or not
We did stay and the desserts were to die for
I recommend the frozen hot chocolate, but big enough to share
Great for kids, but make reservations well in advance!
We visited this famous place on our last trip to NY
We tried to get a reservation, but were denied
After standing in line for about 45 minutes, we got a table
There were 3 empty tables around us for the first 40 minutes, so I'm not sure why we were refused a reservation
The service was horrible, the food was just average, but the desserts were good
The famous frozen hot chocolate is too big for one person, I suggest sharing
They also charge a minimum per person, but it's reasonable
This must be what a dessert-loving chocoholic with a sweet-tooth must envision when they think of heaven
The servings are enormous and they will satisfy your craving for something sweet, guaranteed
Desserts and floats are extraordinary! This place is not where you would want to go to for food
There just isn't enough room for food after the dessert! Order dessert first
I've been here several times and everytime the food was great! I usually go for their infamous Frooozen Hot Chocolates
Only downside is that you may be waiting on line for awhile to get seats if you don't make reservations ahead of time
AS a chocolate lover, I thought this place was one of the best I've been in the city so far
They have something for every dessert lover and awesome hot fudge! Plus it's very cozy and charming inside
Great way to spend a sunday afternoon
One simple word, amazing
What a great experience Serendipity is
So good in face a movie was created around the small shop nestled snug in the big apple

We were seated promplty, and the table was really at an excellent spot, right in front of a french window with the doors open
The atmosphere is really amazing, I truly loved the ambience and the environment
From the very beginning, I could tell that the service was not going to be good, as our server seemed to be not in the best of moods
We ordered a bunch of different plates to try, and the food was not bad at all
A couple of dishes stood out more than others definitely, but overall the food was good, not excellent
The drinks were not bad
After the first few dishes, the service started to slow down; a couple of them were forgotten, the next round of drinks took a while, one of the two deserts was not what we ordered, and the desert wine was forgotten as well
Overall, the service was not good, the food was mediocre with just a couple of dishes standing out, but the place, atmosphere, seating was great
Worth going there once to try it definitely
Spice Mkt is one of those places that you should go to at least once - to take out-of-town guests or just in a big group
Definitely quite a scene, loud, the decor takes center stage, the food is good not great, service is pretty poor
I had a great time with a group of 10 people - loved every minute, but I probably will not go back
It's just one of those places that you go to once
Grab a yummy drink here
You wait because it is that good
yes, we did have to wait a long time for a bar table, even on a Sunday night
But it was fabulous
Surprisingly, I think my favorite was the ginger rice - amazing! We also loved the skate, the hablibut, and the cod
The ginger margarita rocked
I'd go again, so long as I had time to wait
Even though we had to wait a million years for our table we had a wonderful time! The restaurant is gorgeous and the scene is really happening
Even though it was louder than I would have liked it to be, it sort of added to the hip-vibe you got
The food was delish
the Samosas, Squid Salad, and Halibut in particular was amazing, and the Ovaltine Kulfi! We loved out server! She was a beautiful petite Chinese girl who was friendly, warm, and relaxed ---she gave great suggestions and made the experience that much more fun! She was attentive but not annoyingly so--it was refreshing to have her relaxed manner around in a such a loud, hip, jumping place! All in all this is a fun place to go with a big group of friends for a fun dinner with delicious food
Try the Kulfi! and the Pataya!
The lobster rolls were absolutely flavorless
Ive never in my life sent a dish back, but these rolls offended me and I almost called our waiter
Then came some chicken on a stick; if the goal was to deliver a gourmet version of street food, they almost succeeded with this chicken
And finally, I had the sea bass
just disgusting
This meal, in aggregate, managed to put me in a bad mood for the remainder of the afternoon
maybe there's different chef at night and on the weekends (this was a Wednesday lunch)
The first few times I came here it was usually for brunch on Sundays and the service was excellent, only being trumped by the delicious food
I decided to make reservations for four on a Tuesday night and that was a big mistake
The place was packed and there was barely any room to move
We had to wait for a little over an hour just to be seated and then when we were, we were rushed so a group of famous basketball players could be seated
While I love this place, I do recommend going here mostly for lunch or an early dinner because the crowd and long wait can be annoying
This place is wonderful
Make reservations and still arrive prepared to wait 30-45 minutes, but it will be completely worth it
Order appetizers to share and try the day's special
Although we didn't have a reservation, my husband and I enjoyed the food and drinks at the kitchen side seating
The only cons were the uncomfortable bar stools we had to sit on
The food was just incredible and the drinks were too good for words
We had the kumquat mojitos and the mushroom egg rolls
SO GOOD! The service was impeccable
Our waiter was helpful and gave great recommendations
I will be heading back to this incredible eatery soon again!
If you like lousey service, dinning in a loud air plane hanger decorated by Pier One and over-priced, un-inspired food then this is the place for you
one memerable food item was the use of tapioca pearls
Other than that I only ate as much as I did because the price Gauging waiter convinced my party to go with the Chef's Tasting
I knew we were getting screwed when almost 16 appetizers showed up fo 8 people
It wasn't a tasting menue set up by a chef, but a waiter choosing the most expensive items on the menue and ordering them in pairs
Snooty model hostesses and where was a manager? I am tired of screaming over my food and feeling like I'm going deaf
I want a dinning experience not a club experience
I am now turned off from the idea of ever trying other restaurants by Jean Georges
The whole there will be a 30-45 minute wait for a table routine in a half empty bar/restaurant gets really old -- especially in the Meatpacking District, where most of the competition has gotten over it
However, the four children who manage the host/hostess desk serve as good bouncers for an establishment having an identity crisis: Do we want to be a nightclub or do we want to be a restaurant? Hasn't quite figured it out; therefore, has become a tourist trap
This was my third, and last, bad experience at one of Jean George's restaurants
While the decor and ambience are fantastic, the food is absolutely sub-par
I've had better Asian from a food court
The only apparent flavor in any of the dishes was heat, and a table of four gourmands left at least half of our meals on our plates
The waitstaff was also pushy, trying to sell us a bottle of wine priced at (literally) 10 times more than the bottle for which we asked, and wouldn't take no for an answer when it came to dessert
Perhaps if the food had been good we would have wanted more
Don't listen to the negative reviews
This place is so good I can't wait to go back
We were greeted warmly by the lovely hostesses and after just a few minutes at the bar we were seated at a table near the open kitchen
Everything was fantastic
The server was very informative and gave exellent suggestions as the menu is a bit different and served 'family style
' The drinks were potent and delicious
If your looking for an exotic ambiance and great food and service you can't go wrong at SPICE MARKET
I'm telling all my friends
love the ambience, its tribal chic and has a very comfortable feel to it
the dirnks are a tad too sweet, and hte food a tad too greasy and fried
try the short ribs and the spring rolls, but dont go there if you're on a diet
the quality of the food was average but the atmosphere is what you pay for
if you got money to burn check this place out
I went to this restaurant with my gf about 2 years ago before I moved to NYC and this was definatley the best dining experience I've ever had
Excellent staff and decor
Food was perfect as they knew exactly how to time it and they make just the right portions
Left the place feeling completely satisfied
Since moving to NYC I've been to almost every popular restaurant in the city and this remains my favorite
Will be finally going back to this restaurant this weekend (hopefully everything is still the same!)
Went there with my girlfriend after work
Got there at around 6 and were pretty much the first ones there
Decor is amazing
Very trendy
The place filled up extremely fast by the time we left
Food was great
Service excellent
Really no complaints and would definately come back there
My boyfriend and I went for lunch during restaurant week and had a wonderful experience
I had a pretty negative attitude when going after reading all of these terrible reviews - especially about the service - I almost cancelled our reservation
I'm glad I didn't! The maitre'd was very pleasant, the food was excellent, and the service was good
After lunch, we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was also very nice
I don't see where all this negativity is coming from - we had a great experience and I'm looking forward to going back with friends during the TriBeca Film Festival
It is a beautiful beautiful interior
Beautiful furniture and beautiful bath rooms
Waiters and host are really nice too
it is definitely worth checking at least once
But don't go there for their con-fusion food

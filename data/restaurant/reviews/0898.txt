Not only is the coffee amazing (perhaps second only to MUD, and that's hard to beat) but Joe's has that perfect mix of cafe ambiance: writers, readers, gossiping friends
Perhaps you can even enjoy it if you can get a seat (the only time I've been able to get a table w/o waiting is around 11am), though the benches outside are more quickly vacated
Haven't had the food, so can't attest to the baked goods, but the cookies in particular look delicious
Prices are very reasonable: Not bargain basement (and nor should they be) but certainly not outrageous
Very friendly and prompt service
Joe is the only place in the West Village where you can find a decently prepared espresso/cappuccino
I am very picky about my coffee and this is easily the best espresso in the West Village
They use Great Barrington and the baristas know how to properly pull a shot
Terrific~
I do not say this lightly: Joe has ruined me for most other coffee
Go get yourself ruined too
This is definitely the best coffee in NYC, if not the country
My cafe latte was not only gorgeous to look at (all baristas make fern patterns in their milk, apparently), but the perfect flavor, tempertate and texture
These people take their espresso very seriously
Nice people, too
It's not always easy to get a table, but the reason seems obvious
The coffee here is great, but the place always seems to be crowded
Additionally, the service seems to be a little rude
In short, if bad service won't ruin your day, get their coffee to go
The Scene This spacious restaurant held onto the attractive Portuguese tiles (and wine selection) of former occupant Pico--high-backed yellow-and-blue booths, tasseled chairs and white tablecloths
Diners include couples in their '30s seated around a banquet table of older men
The Food The menu is Tuscan
Seasonal ingredients--heirloom tomatoes, green beans, Pecorino fresco and basil--make up the most refreshing starter; there's also pungent baked figs and Gorgonzola with a prosciutto wrapper
The rich braised veal becomes luxuriant when partnered with creamy polenta and wild mushrooms, and both the rib eye and flatiron steaks are excellent cuts, juicy and crisply grilled
Desserts include buttermilk panna cotta with strawberry sauce and a bittersweet-chocolate tart
I was very impressed and very surprised
Dominic is a beatuifully decorated restaurant and bar and the food is of very high quality
If you are looking for authentic italian food, this comes pretty close (I lived in Italy and know good food, so if you have never been in Italy this will seem amazing to you, if you know the real deal it will still be very very good and better than many other italian restaurants around town)
The service was great, relaxed, efficient and professional
Priced right, the food portions are of decent size
I ordered the 5-course tasting menu (two appetizers and three smaller first courses, usually one pasta, one fish, one meat) which I think was around $50, without wine and without dessert
Our Nepalese waiter/manager was very helpful and knew the food
He made great recommendations and was very nice and professional
Overall highly recommended!
what a elegant and very confortable place to go with friends family or business co-workers
its one of my most favorite places
my hats pff to john villa for his fantastic and creative food
the bar is big cool and hip
lf you try it l know you will love it
What a great, elegant, and very comfortable place to go with friends or business folks! Dominic was a blast! I live and work in the area and its my favorite place! The food is fantastic and creative - - not like the same boring cuisine that seems to be the rage with other places, whether you are in Tribeca or uptown
Very cool and hip bar crowd and the bartenders are terrific
You'll love it!
I took my vegan friends to dominic and there was actually something for them to eat on the menu and they loved it! My other guests enjoyed dinner so much that they went back the following Saturday
The food is unlike no other that I have taseted in NYC, the service was outstanding and the decor was just like a movie set! The best dining experience that I have had in a very long time
Went with business colleagues for $20
05 3-course prix fixe lunch
All the food was excellent
I will definitely be returning - and want to try dinner
Portions were certainly substantial for lunch
Tasty caeser salad
Skirt steak medium rare done perfectly
Lovely desserts and coffee
Did I say all for $20

Really, this is truly a Tribeca bargain
The only reason I'm telling you all this is that the place was somewhat empty and I don't want them to close
Service was not great given the waiter only had 3 tables
But the food and price more than made up for it
We made a reservation for a party of 6 people for Valentines Day, i called a few times to change number of people at the table, so they had many oppurtunities to tell us about the obnoxiously priced Pris Fixe menu that offered dismal vegetarian options
We choose the restaurant because their menu online offered interesting well priced vegetarian options
However there was not even the option of ordering from that menu
I love paying $50+ for the chef's harvest vegetables
If you are not going to give us a choice, at least make an effort to make an interesting substantial dish
On a side note, the desserts were wonderful
Food is very good
Atmosphere is very casual chic
Service is excellent
2 for 1 happy hours is great
don't understand why it tends to be empty
This is an excellent restaurant
The overall food quality is top-notch and the service is friendly and attentive
The decor is rather unique - no place quite like it
My wife and I found it a very romantic place to escape the world for a few hours
Go there, you'll definitely be pleased
Here's what's wrong with the place: It's hard to put your finger on it, but the place feels off
You can't figure out what crowd would be drawn to this place, you can't figure out what sort of a mood you're supposed to be in
There's an odd feel to the place
Here's what's right: The food
The chef - starting with the nuts at the bar mixed with roasted roasemary sprigs - does something new and interesting with most of what you're offered there
Really
I wasn't that impressed with the desserts, but the appetizers, the main courses - it's hard to list because I waited too long afterwards since I was last there, but I've been back 3 times now
And I don't live in Tribeca
If it weren't for the chef, I wouldn't reccomend the place as anything more than nice
We had dinner at Dominic and believe that the changes recently made are terrific
A great new bar with much more space makes it a perfect place to hang with friends or dine on absolutely terrific food - we enjoyed everything about this American/Italian restaurant
Best pasta and steaks! Can't disagree more with the Citysearch reviewer; however, we had a great time
Definitely a place to return to again and again
It is Cinco de Mayo every night at Mama Mexico!! Mama offers the best of everything from a mariachi band that actively engages the entire restaurant to frozen margaritas that make you kiss manana goodbye! I have referred many people to this restaurant and everyone LOVES it! Sure the service at times can be slow but once you enter this Mexican oasis and taste their drinks and guacamole
you won't want to leave!
Have been a few times for lunch and do not plan on going back
Prices are way too expensive for mediocre food at best, excpet for the guacamole, which is VERY good
I don't know about dinner, but at lunch time it is very crowded
The waiters knocked over my purse 3 times and spilled water on the table 3 times as well
We also waited a good half hour for our meals
However, the ambiance is awesome
A little cheesy, but if you let that go, you feel like you are in Mexico
The people writing good reviews for this place must be getting paid
Apparently making a reservation for 2 for 7p
m
is too much to ask for so we waited for 1/2 hour

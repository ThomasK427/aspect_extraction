The place is absolutely wonderfull!!!!!!! And the quality of the food is excellent
My experience in Buenos Aires was really great
I had the best steak i ever had in Manhattan
The ribe eye is highly recomended and also the Malbec wine Zuccardi Ql
I enyoyed a lot Buenos Aires because of the food, the wine and the wonderfull ambience and friendly service
The dessert is like grandma's dessert
The decor is simple and makes you focus on your date
and the meat! My date RAVED about his filet mignon, but I stayed true (like prior reviews) to the entrana (skirt steak)
PERFECTLY cooked as requested
The HOMEMADE chorizo is spicy and has snap
The empanadas are wonderful too, to start
If you still have room after you eat, indulge in a dessert (flan misto is the house favorite)
or a port wine! Friendly service too! If you are really lucky
the owner may come around and chat with you a bit
It really feels like an old, neighborhood joint
The setting is suave, dark, and 1950s -- brick wall on one side, red-painted on the other
Most tables fit two, we came in as five
With a quirky, yet delightful wait staff, we attempted to order sophisticated dishes (read: sweet bread, their many sausages) only to be shot down and asked to re-order - that's an interesting dish, but not our finest
The four page menu became a list of four menu items - steak, steak, and steak
But it was excellent
With a choice of filet, ribeye, skirt, ribs, and others, the best selection was ribeye: not as dry as the skirt and a little fattier than the filet
You may call the meal a bit of a simple, maybe even childish, steak and salad meal, but the wine and appetizers demand its graduation from kindergarten to grown-up stuff
Wash it down with a nice Argentinean wine (go for the Malbec with a blend of Cabarnet, Merlot, and Syrah) and you have yourself an excellent meal
And don't forget the interesting cheese and meats appetizer with fine salami, chorizo, and proscuitto as well as three mild cheeses (my guess - brebis and vache milk)
One complaint - the post-meal garlic breath and garlic flavored burping the next morning
The sauce for the steak would have kept any vampire away at least until noon the next day
And one member of the party had the chicken champignon
We asked the waiter how is the chicken, he replied in his eccentric, terse manner, Well, it's chicken
He forgot to mention that it's five-glasses-of-water-later salty chicken
In short, recommended!  - New York Dining Club
Okay, I hate eating at 7 or 7:30 pm (still feels too early), but I did not mind for Buenos Aires
Part of the earlyness was because of our large group size (though they don't take reservations, you can give them a HEADS UP if you call earlier so they can start setting up a table area), 14, and the flavors and textures of the food were excellent
Any empanada is worth trying-flaky but not heavy, savory and hearty
They even have ones w/o meat, for those who are vegetarian
The churrasco is homemade and SPECTACULAR and has a little spicy flair to it
Obviously, if you are here to dine, you are likely a carnivore
Their signature dish is the Entrana (skirt steak - it's a churrasco, if you will)
Flavorful, juicy (mine, medium rare) - arrive hungry, so you can finish it
They also make pasta and parmagiano dishes if you aren't into a steak
Sorry, no hard alcohol sold here, but who cares? Have a beer or try any of the numerous Argentinian wines (there's a fantastic oak-fermented one, reasonably priced!)
Dessert was standard stuff - wonderful sorbets! I hear the flan mixto is great (had no room to even try it)
but next time, I'll try the port that 2 people at our table had
Smelled strong but the flavor was concentrated and sweet and it also had a smooth finish
I left quite happy (and stuffed)!!
The place was good and the churrasco that I odrdered was grilled very well
The empanadas were heavenly but the wait was long
The servings are really big so arrive hungry and don't order too much - I couldn't finish my meal
Overall this is a nice place
I love this place
The filet mignon I ordered was cooked perfectly
The malbec fabre was exquisite and the price was very reasonable
Thank you very much Buenos Aires
I really enjoyed eating here
the food was incredible and the service too
the only argentinian restaurant with over fifty different types of wine from argentina
try the navarro corea
the grilled sweat breads were mouth watering
and the price really unbelievable
I definitely will come back
I really enjoyed this place
the food is out of this world
the wine list is long and accomadates all tastes
the service makes you feel at home like the way mom takes care of you when you go visit her
HAVE KIDS? no problem here
just an all around great eating experience
I've been to this place twice in the last few weeks
Both times I had the filet w/ peppercorn sauce an mixed veggies @ $23 + per plate
Both times an awesome piece of meat and easily equal if not better than cuts I've had for north of $35
I tried the grilled octopus appetizer which was mouth watery, and also the grilled calamari salad which was delectable
For dessert, definitely try the caramel flan
its not generic flan, but an absolute dream
Also, try the 20-year old port (for $10)
An absolute steal in NYC
The only negatives I would say are: (a) the word is definitely way out on this place so if you go there fri - sun after 7 PM, you'll have to wait
Also, another downside is that some of the patrons go there and order like nothing, but yap for hours while others of us are menu tasters and will spend accordingly
They have some sign up now that you have to spend $30 per person during world cup soccer, but good luck enforcing that one
I will also say that the wines we tried were not special
I belive we tried the Malbecs, both Oak barreled and non
No offense to Argentines on this board, but perhaps they do not keep the wines well over there due to the heat from the kitchen, etc
Overall a great place, but extremely small space
Oh, and the last time I went, the busboy took my $20 port which was half full at the time (probably in a rush to get us out of there due to the wait behind us)
A quick complaint to the owner and I was given a replacement
No worries
Great place, but prepare to wait
btw,
I am not Argentine but lived in Argentina many years
Frankly I have been deeply disappointed by other steak places in New York, particularly those that call themselves Argentine, most of them are extremely expensive but with meat of low quality and if they have good meat most of the time they do not know how to grill it
The ambiance is great, very easy going and the service is excellent
I have made it a habit to eat there every Sunday, but unless you eat at unusual times (like I do) you better make a reservation
Try it you wont regret it
The food's good, the wine's moderately priced and the ambience is fine
It's just
you had better be from Argentina
They dont take reservations and after waiting for over 2 hours it was frustrating to see that people were skipped in front of you just because they happened to be from the same country as the maitre d'
That said there arent any other decent steak places in the East Village so if youre hankering for some cow go early, go weekdays or just practise your Buenas Aires lisp and youre all set
I found this wonderfull place in my neighborhood
The best steak and the best price you can find
And ald have free wireless conection for my laptop
The service and the people who work at Buenos Aires are so friendly and nice
Great Place, Great Food!!!!

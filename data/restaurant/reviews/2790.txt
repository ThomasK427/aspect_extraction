You must have their gyro or souvlaki platter, with a nice glass of beer
It's the BEST!
The Scene Graziella has a loyal customer base and makes few concessions to the outside world
The small single room--wood panelling, large mirrors, white tablecloths, dim lighting--has few frills
Service is unhurried at best, so be prepared for a leisurely meal
The Food The meal begins slowly, with a plate of excellent garlic knots
Pungent, salty salad of roasted peppers dressed with bagna cauda is an excellent appetizer; likewise the eggplant involtini, filled with creamy fresh mozzarella
For the second course, a variety of fine pastas include the whopping linguine allo Scoglio, a sizeable plateful of noodles topped with seafood in a rich tomato sauce
A giant order of tender gnocchi larded with sweet sausage meat is also very flavorful
The other side of the menu offers chicken, veal, and seafood standards, including perfect saltimbocca and a huge, succulent veal chop
For dessert, there's sublime cheesecake
The food was ok, common italian food maybe a bit better than the average Pizzeria
Prices were very high for what you got and the service was less than stellar
The canolli I had for dessert was not fresh and that was very disappointed
The night I was there, besides extraordinary food and service, the owners; Carmelo Leotta and Pietro Cinquemani were belting out Mario Lanzi tunes on the Steinway piano
Tenor Robert L Uhl was present and provided excellent background vocals
I can honestly say that they have the most amazing food here
There really isn't a bad dish on the menu
They have amazing specials all the time - seafood, meat, pasta
My personal favorite is the Saltimbocca Ala Romana
They have a distict way of making it
Very different from any other place i have had it
The ultimate best though!!
Myself and two of my friends decided to try this based on citysearch reviews
let me tell you DON'T
i tried to call to make reservations the night before, but they told me to call back tomorrow
i asked for the dress code and he told me to call back tomorrow
?!?!?!
Even after this weird phone call we decided to try it anyway
Well I can't tell you how the food was because the moment we walked in, the single waiter was extremely rude and told us to wait outside while he cleared a table (in the middle of winter) because he was busy
let me tell you, there were plenty of tables available
because he was so rude we left and went somewhere else
if that's how they treat customers i can't imagine anything else could be good
This coffee shop offers many varieties of food
It has great service great food
This coffee shop is in excistance for more than 25 years
If you want to try Korean-Japanese Sasimi, please visit! Good Quality and Service!
As you enter this ultra-clean establishment, you are usually pleasantly greeted by either owner, Ernesto or his wife Karen
If you stop by the bar, you get to see one of the best mechanics with a terrific personality behind the bar, Alex he also is the manager of the restaurant
Once seated, the food is one of the best kept secrets in Northern Queens
Fresh fish, tender milk fed veal and outrageous Veal Chops adorn their menu and special list
It's truly a dining out pleasure to go to Ernestos
me and the boyfriend ordered 5 rolls- 2 of them were wonderful (the King Kong and Where is Charmine, we think they allow regulars to name new rolls), 1 was mediocre, and the last 2 were TERRIBLE
one made me gag once I putit in my mouth
My bf tried it too and he thinks the mayo was expired
Its not romantic, but the service is friendly after they start recognizing you
Its not particularly CLEAN, but its tolerable (I had to clean a bit of dirt off)
We gave it an 8 even though less than 50% of our food was good
Why? because they have over 100 special rolls to choose from, and frmo the menu I can take a guess that you can even order a roll with whatever you want in it
Maybe we just happened to order 2 of the worst rolls on the menu
Try to get rolls that are more cooked than raw, because their raw didn't seem too fresh which may have also contributed to the suckiness of the last two rolls
Ginza is worth a try, its not that expensive, and with such a lengthy menu you're sure to find something that you like, even if youre not a big Sushi fan
The food is wonderful
This restaurant is in our neighborhood, where there are more than a few sushi places, but this one remains our favorite
It's a little too wide open to be romantic, but the service for us has always been excellent and the food is consistently great!
The previous 3 reviewers seem to be raving about this place, but after going there last night I have to assume they are friends or relatives of the owners
My husband and I got there and we were standing at the entrance like dolts waiting to be seated by the waitress/hostess/busboy/cashier
She tells us to come in, and then she had us standing in the middle of the restaurant like idiots when we decided to just take our own seats at this corner table near the kitchen/whatever
When were were seated there were no utensils, napkins, we had to ask for water, and to take our order
The napkins and utensils were practically thrown at us and I had to set them up
The ambience is
there is no ambience
The food is so so
I've had better
I don't we will be going back
They have the friendliest staff there
The service and the food are impecable
Just looking at the different names that they have for the sushi rolls will get you to laugh
I highly recommend this place
This little underrated sushi spot is terrific, the 2 sushi chefs are truly masters and the food is out of this world
You really can't go wrong with anything and the huge list of rolls and raw fish is unreal
I highly recommend this restaurant for its food, and value
The ambience is pretty good too
Try it, you'll love it!
This is a small place right in the middle of Bayside
I have eaten sushi all over NYC (Yama, Nobu) as well as a few places in other states
So far, I haven't found anything better
The sushi is just amazing and not very expensive
Don't bother with the menu, just look at the specialty rolls they have on the walls
Also try the TAKO sallad (octipus salad), it's the only place that has it and it's probably the best thing that they have besides the sushi
They are moving to 33-41 Francis Lewis Blvd
It's the same block as before, just a few doors down
The food is simply sub-par and they use too much rice which lessens the taste of the sushi
The sushi is also very dry and boring
It also takes an unbearably long time to deliver the vile food, to a nearby location
Overall it is sub-par and Not recommended at all
In Short A low-key, friendly environment attracts plenty of families to this reliable chain
Kids in the big booths--often clutching free balloons and crayons--usually outnumber adults sitting at the bar
The menu offers filling American fare with no surprises, from mozzarella sticks and nachos to rollups and burgers
Entrees include steaks, fajitas and main dish salads
The calorie-conscious can select from a list of Weight Watchers-inspired dishes like mesquite chicken salad and grilled tilapia with mango salsa
the service here, albeit a little slow on weekends, is so friendly
I have not yet had a rude waiter/waitress or host/hostess and I've been coming to this applebee's for about 6 years
Personally, after shopping a little and skimming book as barnes noble applebees really hits the spot
The only problem would be that I am very impatient and I absolutely HATE the 20-30 minutes wait for a table on weekends
Other than that I love going here
The food here is absolutely GREAT
Very romantic, good food, good service
Dont forget to leave room for dessert! Had a great time
Although this place is known most for its catering facilities, it is an excellent choice for celebrating an intimate occasion

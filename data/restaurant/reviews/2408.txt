I always bring my out-of-town guests here and they all love it
The desserts are great, but overpriced
Don't waste your time and money eating regular food here, just go straight for the sugar
The two hour wait during peak hours is ludicrous! I wouldn't recomend this place except
mmm, those desserts
Serendipity has some of the best desserts in NYC
YES, you're going to wait awhile, and the service is not always going to be quick, but that's usually because many people come from all over to eat here
And this IS NY so don't go expecting to get value for your money
Go as late as you can for dessert (eat dinner someplace else) and wait outside for your table
But definitely go
So worth it
I must say that I was drawn to this place after watching Serendipity the movie since it was so sweet
The only thing I ordered was the frozen hot chocolate because it's supposed to be a favorite there
However, it wasnt that great
I wasn't really expecting a chunk of frozen hot chocolate
I just thought that was the name for the ice cream
As for the service, it was okay as long
I didn't find anyone rude
It was just a normal place
I found the inside to be a bit dark though
But the lamps where quite pretty
As an ice cream addict, I knew I wanted to visit Serendipity 3 on my first trip to NYC last week, but I wasn't sure what to expect after reading all the bad reviews on this site
I was pleasantly surprised
The man working the register in the small gift shop was extremely friendly and our waiter was polite and courteous
The desserts were heavenly! I'm not sure the people who wrote the bad reviews went to the same restaurant
I will definitely visit Serendipity on my next trip to NYC
A friend of mine and I bumped into this restaurant last week and it didn't look like any special place on the outside, but when we looked at the menu we decided to give it a try
We were absolutely astonished with the amazing food they had and the incredible choice of French traditional dishes and also the timely service
The interior is very cozy
Highly recommend it! We had dinner there for about 3 hours
A few of my friends had recommended this place
I finally had a chance to go for their unbeatable $13 prix fixe lunch
Garlic chicken special, steamed mussels and linguine with seafood were all absolutely delightful
Very casual, relaxed, nurturing atmosphere
It wasn not very busy when I went (Sunday afternoon) but it would probably be busy around dinner time
One of the best french restaurants I have been in
There are no pretentious waiters and waitresses, just fun-loving, smily people at this East side place
It is small, dimly light and remainiscent of a small quiet restaurant you'd find in europe
Authentic french cuisine complete with a traditional offering of sausages, fruits and vegetabes in lieu of bread before you even begin your meal
The outside does not look promising but the atomostphere inside is so homey that you instantly relax
The Scene It's a time warp--Paris, 1945
The faded, wood-lined dining room is adorned with maps, photos and posters
Up front is a small bar where the legendary storyteller and proprietor, Monsieur Robert, welcomes every customer, most of whom have been coming here since John Lindsay was mayor
If the phone rings while Monsieur Robert is weaving a yarn, the nearest diner is expected to answer it
The Food The menu is right out of Escoffier: skate au beurre noir, homemade pork terrines, coq au vin, grilled hanger steaks with French fries, roasted chicken, monkfish with lobster sauce--all perfectly satisfying
The cassoulet is one of the best in town, rich with duck confit
For starters there are leeks vinaigrette, escargot with garlic butter, onion soup and more
For dessert, go for the classic oeufs a la neige if Monsieur Robert doesn't talk you into trying one of his special boozed up crepes
Hemingway was a regular-two steps down and you are transported into a different era
The paintings on the wall, including the sleeping calf are priceless
The food is a classic
Bistro quality that is the best in Manhattan
Robert Treboux is the oldest French restauranteur in New York right now and well worth a visit just to see him
He will tell you stories about the  second world war and french cusine
While most restaurants have come and gone-he has remained
The wine cellar is truly an landmark
While most of the wines are not on the wine list- they are in the basement
There are more rare and obscure bottles down there than any other French restaurant in Manhattan
The food is from Haute Savoie and the only restaurant in existance in Manhattan that specializes in food from that region of France
Le Veau D'Or is truly unique and well worth the visit
Highly recommended
I went here on my honeymoon after reading about it on citysearh
This place is very cool
It is a tiny place and was not busy when we went
I had the skate
I have never had fish like this
It had a thin crust that had a lemon flavor
Trust me you need to eat at this place before you die
I bring every new date to this place
If Robert has seen you more than once, you're family
If you consistenly bring cute dates, you're in the will
The food is consistenly amongst the best in the city, the old-world ambience will make any newbie fall in love with the place and Robert will make you feel as if you're a member of the court
Trust me, if you go to this place on a date, you're going to be kindly rewarded
For the record, this used to Hemmingway's old haunting ground back in the day
From the minute your host, Robert Treboux, welcomes you at the door, you can't help but feel drawn into another time and place
The ambience is Paris Bistro and the food, delicious!
My wife and I went here and had a fantastic dinner
We came in as the dinner rush was starting and they seated us immediately in a cozy corner with a skylight
The server was prompt and professional
The escargot was the best I have ever had
My wife loved her Monkfish and the lamb is to die for
Desserts are a must
The wine selection is good as well
Had a wonderful evening at Jubilee
Greatly enjoyed the food
The lamb is superb
Would highly recommend this place
Given the great food and service, it was surprising that they used paper mats on top of the tableclothes
My wife and I have been coming to this restaurant for well over two years, and we have not once been disappointed
The food is fantastic
It is now the *ONLY* place in the city where we order Mussels (Poulette is my favorite!)
Also try the Pork Tenderloin superb!   The service is just as impressive
Staff remains pretty much the same over the years, and the waiters are very knowledgeable and courteous
Do make a reservation because this place does get busy for dinner!  As far as ambience goes, Jubilee is simple but very cozy
Its certainly romantic enough, but has none of the stuffiness prevalent in some of the other French restaurants
NOTE: check out the new 51st Street location! Similar menu, same quality, but easier to make a reservation on short notice
This place is head shoulders above most other restaurant in the area!
I found Jubilee using city search, and I have to say it was one of the best finds
Everything about the restaurant was perfect
The meal was absolutely incredible, and very reasonably priced

Friends and I have frequented this place many, many times
We were drawn to the ambience, outdoor seating, inexpensive menu, and great food
But the staff is consistently rude, including the owner
We overlooked it for a while
But the food quality hasn't been as good, and the service has never gotten better
This place looks like a quant neighborhood restaurant, but it lacks warmth, friendliness and appreciation for its patrons
Maybe the owner should remember that its the locals that will keep you in business!
I live close by and I love that I have such a great neighborhood restaurant
The decor is so beautiful with a nice combination of modern old Brooklyn
Service is friendly, paninis, french fries and salads are great
The food was great, service atrocious
Even though I specified eggplant parm entree and POINTED TO IT on the menu, I was brought the panini
When I told the server it was wrong, I got no apology or indication of how long it would take
I stared at my husbands entree for 15 minutes before my dinner came out
No apology, no explanation
Then I ordered the apple tart w/ vanilla gelatto for dessert
The server hands it to me, sans gelatto
I say: ummm, I thought this comes with gelatto
And she said, yeah it does, but the kitchen staff said you wouldn't need it?!?!?! Then it takes 10 minutes to get the gelatto on it; by then the warm tart was cold
The final frustration came when she brought my credit card slip and the pen didn't work
We ate dinner at Bar Toto this evening
We appreciate the fair prices, but the waitstaff was completely absent, and the food was not good
There are so many amazing restaurants in this area, Bar Toto cannot afford to have the poor, slow service and completely uninteresting food that they serve
Pay for bread on the table? C'mon guys
Bar Toto has become my default restaurant in the neighborhood
I return again and again for their delicious paninis and pasta
Occasionally, I've had to wait a bit for my check, but other than that, I've never had bad service or received any attitude from the staff
It's great to sit outside on a summer night and enjoy a bottle of wine
This restaurant is almost across the street from where I live, so I was excited to see great prices for good (enough) food
I have been here plenty of times and have been treated badly on a number of occasions by some of the servers and manager
In a neighborhood like Park Slope, where there are great restaurants with wonderful service, it's hard to reconcile eating mediocre food served with attitude
It's a shame to treat locals poorly when that's the majority of your business
The Best Burgers in The City
No joke, this joint kicks butt and the prices are fantastic
The staff is incredible and always so lovely and friendly (Peter, Stefanie, Jorge and everybody)
The Drinks are amazing (great Martinis) and they have a great selection of Wines and Amaros(digestivis after dinner)
It's great every day of the week
The Toto Burger (a paninni pressed burger with gorgonzola cheese and caramelized onions, Oh my God so delish) is my favorite but I've tried everything and it's all great
It's a very fine dining experience at great price
Go and enjoy
Bar Toto is a great place for a casual Friday night out
Everything on the menu is $10 or less - pizzas, paninis and pastas
Great deal - great local place!
Really a horrible experience
Food was cold when it arrived, waitress would vanish for 30 minute periods before reappearing, wrong side dishes were served, meals improperly cooked, and the manager failed to apologize when confronted
Will never go back
Do not go here
Our orders were messed up, our waitstaff was unattentive and upon speaking with the manager regarding our list of problems (please note we had been at the restaurant for two hours attempting to get sandwiches) we were turned away smuggly
It was as though we inconvienced HIM by speaking of the terrible service and policies of this restaurant
I will never go to Times Square Brewery again, and if you value your time and energy, you won't either
I went to the Times Square Brewery and it was a good time but nothing particularly special
I like breweries and wanted to try the sampler
It was good solid beer
I've actually never eaten here, but I have seen their incredibly expensive menu
That is of no surprise since this brewery is literally in the thick of Times Square
Their beer on the other hand is reasonably priced and their local brews are halfway decent
I recommend coming here during a late week night when all the bars around are closed
Its fun to drink and people watch from this location
We tried to give the Times Square Brewery a shot two times and both times were terrible
Forget getting good service
We waited for a straw, a glass of water, appetizers, and someone to clean off the table before dessert arrived
Dinner showed up undercooked and tasteless! No problem delivering the bill though
Save your time and money and eat anywhere else
Even Bubba Gumps Shrimp Restaurant is better food with better service
This restaurant should stick to just serving beer, which was good
However, the rest of the dining experience was absolutely terrible
The order was screwed several times either by the server or the kitchen
Every time the food was sent back, the order, to correct the restaurants mistakes, was put behind every other order in the restaurant
The entire ordeal took about two and a half hours for two sandwiches and some fries
The excuse given to us for the long wait was the restaurant was very busy that day, but the dining room was not even half full
I had finished my meal but we were waiting about an hour for my wife's meal to come back from all the mistakes and wrong orders brought to our table
The couple next to us was so fed up they left before their meals even arrived
A friend and I went on a Friday night and we had a great time
It was not too crowded and we were seated right away
The waiter came and within minutes we had our drinks and our orders taken
The food was very good for American Bar food, expensive, but I expect nothing else of eating in Times Square and compared to the Applebees next door it was a steal!   We tried the beer sampler and it was great and did not seem too expensive, which I would recommend - gives you a little variety
We loved some of the beers and after spending a year in Germany; we both thought that they measured up to good beer standards
My favorite was the pilsner! Overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
The food is decent but overpriced
If you go to this restaurant for dessert and coffee, the hostess will send you upstairs
Once you get there, no one will show you to a table; they'll just tell you to move to another table when you sit down
A waittress will come by, drop menus on your table without acknowledging you; then she'll go to a party of 8 and work that table for tips
Someone else will come along and take your order
Then the first waittress will come by to take away your plate when you're finished
As you're enjoying the last few sips of your coffee, the waittress will finally acknowledge you by saying, We're having a private party here and we need this table, would you mind moving to another table?  There are so many restaurants in New York City, don't waste your money here
In Short This cavernous, woodsy restaurant, decorated with old Brooklyn photos, vintage Williamsburg maps and scads of plants, matches its throwback details--including the "h" in its name--with some old-time cooking
Dinner entrees of meatloaf, wood-fired pizzas and fried chicken follow varied styles of waffles, eggs Benedict and grits for brunch
The kitchen is also big on seafood, balancing its down-home cuisine with nightly oysters on the half shell
Bring your family, bring a real date, the almost embarrassing underside to the Burg's hipster cred
this place gives out plates of warm bread for brunch, and has live piano music! Good drinks, decent food; if small portions--very friendly
very easy
Does not feel like a New York restaurant at all which could be a good or a bad thing
The food is a bit pricey but the oysters were some of the best I've ever had
Good place for groups of four or large parties but it is not a cozy/intimate setting for 2 although the jazz helps!
If you plan a party here, you will be very unhappy with the service
I had a bridal shower for my daughter here
First, the room was not ready at the appointed time, we had to wait at the bar for an hour and they wanted to split the party in two rooms
The service was extremely slow and they treated us very rudely, I felt like we were being rushed after the food was finally served
We were supposed to have 4 hours for our party, it was delayed, the time should have been extended but it wasn't
The manager came out in front of everyone while my daughter was opening gifts and asked who was responsible for the bill

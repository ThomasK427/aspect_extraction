75 for it as though it were gourmet instead of the truck stop coffee it is
Good coffee would complement the fine pastries, rather than sour the experience
Buy your desserts here, but get your coffee at Sensuous Bean on Columbus and 70th
Hey New Yorkers! Here is an example of good coffee
Instead of going to Starbucks or worse, Dunkin Donuts and coffee carts, come to this mom-and-pop place
The service is friendly, helpful, and quick
There are many different varieties of coffees and teas that you can buy by the pound (or less) and make yourself
You can also buy a cup of coffee to go
While it has no seating and is just a place to buy bulk coffee and teas, its quality and service make any coffee or tea lover waj at the knees
The Scene Meals here unfold with all the pageantry one would expect from a restaurant that ranks among the world's fine-dining vanguard
The main dining room, decorated in gray, cream and olive, is spare and elegant, while expansive windows bring the vigor and excitement of Broadway tableside
The coolly efficient waitstaff is one of the best in the business
The Food There are moments--in the first spoonful of the lobster tartine's pumpkin seed, fenugreek broth; the first bite of scallops that catches a caper-raisin emulsion--that are powerful enough to change the way you perceive taste, powerful enough to leave you genuinely breathless
The chef works in a hugely ambitious style of contemporary French cuisine, one that centers on immensely pungent yet lightweight broths and sauces
Seven-course tasting menus offer the shortest roads to Vongerichten classics
what a place after all these years and celebrity chef business ventures this place still has that classic french elegance, there are not many restaurants left that are like this one
all new restaurants are more chic now , what ever that means!!! does it mean only chicks go there who knows but the classic tasting menu still is amazing
service is top noch yet proffecional
My husband took me to the Nougatine Room for my birthday
We were seated promptly but the waiter seemed to forget about us once he took our drink ordered
I asked for a twist in my martini had to hunt down a back waiter for a piece of lemon
We ordered wine by the glass and continued to have an empty glass most of the evening
I guess unless you order by the bottle, they don't considered you a serious wine enthusiast
We even asked to see the menu for the formal dining room and that never appeared
For a restaurant that prides itself on service, we felt very much abandoned
Really wonderful, prompt, efficient service (they brought over a surprise dessert for me because it was my graduation), and the food is astounding course after course
Nothing disappoints here
i love this restaurant and i always will, but the service has definitely taken a wrong turn
its just not as good as i always remembered it, but its worth waiting for, for the most part
the terrace outside is very nice! i would say 9

I went to Jean Georges the other night with my fiance and had the most amazing meal of my life
I had never been before, but plan on going many more times
I was so well taken care of I couldn't believe it
We had lunch here whilst visiting NYC
The value was amazing, $28 for two courses and $8 for pudding
I had to order an extra course for $12
The food was consistently good
I had heard that the chef specialised in Asian influenced food, so I ordered a classic French dish and two Asian influenced dishes
I'm not normally a fan of 'fusion', but Im struggling to think if Ive ever had a better dish than the veal cheeks with soy glaze
I had only one fault with all 6 dishes, amuse boushe and tasting deserts that we had
My girlfriend had prawns with a mustard and passion fruit sauce and the mustard was totally overpowering, but that is a small gripe
The service was not what you would get at a three Michelin star restaurant in Europe
Our waiter insisted on announcing each dish in an annoyingly smug way
After not dining at Vong for a number of years my husband and I recently returned for an after theatre dinner
We were pleasantly surprised to see this restaurant that's been open for 14 years still thriving, and feeling fresh, and updated
The food was as good as I remember it, with professional service
I noticed new silverwear, new banquettes and what seems to be a new sound system
We look forward to returning as regulars
The best gift we recieved for our wedding was a tasting dinner for the two of us, in Jean Georges
The best food I have ever had, amazing and gracious service
We keep looking for reasons to go back there
Food is excellent, but the Host was extremely snobby
We had dinner before a show at Lincoln Center
After the show, we went back to have drinks at the bar and we were told no Jeans allowed
We just ate there in jeans a few hours prior
VEveryone was in jeans - it was right after a snow storm - I think they forget they are a 'hotel bar'
After a two-month wait we dressed to impress for our late night dinner at Jean-Georges in Trump's International hotel
The minimalist decor was a big disappointment (nothing to write home about--the ground floor entrance to the impersonal steel bar leads to a plain dining room with traffic views) but the food was worth writing volumes (especially the foie gras with sour cherries and flamed pistachio topping--more like a fabulous dessert!) Order the chef's Winter or Summer tastings (or both for $125 each)and be prepared for ENDLESS unique and varied courses, including the signature Egg Caviar (caviar, whipped cream and vodka all in a special blown egg
) We saw a young man propose on one knee in a romantic upholstered booth in the back! How could she say no sitting in the NY Times 4-star restaurant (one of only five) and in the hands of NYC's #1 chef?
The $125 dinner tasting menu was decent, but certainly nothing to write home about
None of my dishes stood out, except for the snapper which was completely uncooked in the center
they took the fish back and brought an overcooked snapper back (to be expected)
The service was just average for a top notch restaurant: cold robotic
Atmosphere in the formal room was nice, but the informal dining room was extremely loud which ultimately made the formal room louder than my perference
Overall, my guests and I agreed that there is no good reason for us to return
The innovative French cooking places Jean Georges as one of the best restaurants in the world
The first taste of a number of the dishes was ethereal and will remain with me for a long time
Server was very knowledgeable and wine list was reasonable
Think of the best restaruant you have eaten at in the last 5 years and then give JG a comparison try
You will not be disappointed
The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that the decor is so not impressive at all
It is so plain looking- I guess less is more
Other than that, the food here is excellent
They serve the best scallops in the world
Foie gras was amazing
I absolutely love their artic char and corn ravioli
Their desserts are out of this world
Service was flawless
Would definitely dine here again
It was my anniversary and I took my wife there for lunch
I really wanted to like the place
The decor was very simple minimalist
The ambience was semi romantic and semi business
Unfortunately, the food was NOT very good at all
My wife and I tried the summer tasting menu
We ordered 8 different dishes
None of them were balanced
Everything was overseasoned with salt and overwhelming with citrus flavor
I couldn't taste any of the meat/fish in the dishes
Service was inconsistent
Sometimes friendly and sometimes snooty
It was the one of the worse $200 I ever spent
Overall, this place is overrated and way to expensive for the quality of food
That is really all that needs to be said
This restaurant is always highly rated so I figured the experience would be wonderful
It was ok at best for the rating it has
Dessert was great but the dinner was eh
Temper your expectations for this one
I came here for lunch, with a reservation

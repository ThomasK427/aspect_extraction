I've been looking for a good place to take clients near fifth ave, and I'm so happy to find this
It's sleek without being to fashion-victim, which is a nice change
The food was right on, service great, nice wine list
I would def
recommend it
Not to mention, the bartenders were nice to look at while I was waiting for my client to arrive!
The 16 oz prime strip looked like a 14 oz choice cut
The Grey Goose tasted liked it had been pourd from a smirnoff bottle, The room was empty I elt like I was the only person in the city who didn't know this place was a poor choice for a good steak
They didn't have my first 3 wine bottle selections
Though the service was good, it is hard for a waitstaff to overcome poor food quality, incompetent managers and do well at a over priced restaurant
For my money, you should try any other steak house, or any other restaurant (except Bennigans) But, at the end, my server mark gave me a 'cool' postcard for 10% off my next visit, but then again, who would want to visit more then once?
In a town where appearance is often more important than quality, Savannah Steak provides a healthy dose of both
Try the Porterhouse Steak for two, possibly the best in NYC city
The service was friendly and unpretentious, a rarity in a NY Steakhouse but welcomed nonetheless
The winelist has a few California gems and is fairly priced though it may take one or two tries for the waiter to find something in stock
The happy hour bar scene, though a bit noisy, is electric and provides great energy throughout the night
You may wait a few minutes for a drink but the great looking bartenders are suprisingly friendly and worth the wait
An overall great experience and a terrific midtown option
MY DAUGHTER AND I MADE OUR FIRST TRIP TO NYC DECEMBER 4TH
SAWTHIS THIS RESTAURANT ON OPEN TABLE WEBSITE
WE ARRIVED THE NIGHT OF THE ROCKEFELLER TREE LIGHTING AND COULDN'T GET A TAXI TO SAVANNAH'S - WALKED FROM THE MARRIOTT MARQUIS AND ASKED DIRECTIONS FROM PEOPLE ON THE STREET
SERVER WAS FANTASTIC - THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS AND THE DESSERTS WERE VERY DECADENT AND WELL PORTIONED
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD - I WAS TOLD THE $20
02 PRICE FIXE MEAL WAS AVAILABLE UNTIL 6:00 (WE ARRIVED BEFORE 6:00), UPON ARRIVAL, WERE TOLD THE PRICE-FIXE WAS OVER AT 2:00 P
M
I HAD ALREADY ORDERED A BOTTLE OF PINOT GREGIO, SO WE ORDERED SALADS (FILET MIGNON AND CHICKEN), AND DESSERT
I OVER-EXTENDED MY BUDGET, HOWEVER, THE RESTAURANT WAS GORGEOUS AND THE SERVER WAS THE BEST EVER
IF I EVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE NY AGAIN, I WILL DEFINITELY GO TO SAVANNAHS
This place is not worth it
The staff members are retarded
A ghost town has more people than this place on a Saturday evening
Goto Dylan Prime instead
We went to Savannah with a party of twelve in mid- November (soon after opening) and experienced very few kinks in the operation
The food was great
A classy atmosphere but very inviting as well
A sleek trendy feel, and solid service
Appreciated the owner's wine suggestions
It stands out in a city of stellar steakhouses
We'll definitely be back
aside from too many tables in the room and the fact that your couldn't hear what anyone was saying in the loud, high ceiling dining room


savannah steak is a welcome addition to midtown where there are a dearth of hip spots that have some hop later in the evening
We arrived to find the atmosphere very upbeat with a touch of class
The wine cellar in the middle of the floor is a very nice touch
With Bacchus at my side we endeavored into the wine list
While our first selection was not in the cellar, they had plenty of backup
Most at the table ordered the Strip
My cut was marginal at best and cooked a bit over medium (my fault should have ordered med rare) - I'd have to honestly say that I have had better, I've also had way worse
The steak sauce, if you like that sort of stuff, was excellent
Everyone seemed satisfied and our wives seemed to enjoy everthing immensely - which is always a good thing
Overall I would return for another shot at the steak
All of the positive things about this place make you want to come back
All around great experience, from the food to the customer service
Lovely renovations to the former Blake's!
The only times that i have experienced customer service on par with what we were treated to here have been in restaurants where i knew the owner
We called for last minute reservations for a party of 6, and not only did they take us but we were waited on as if we were old friends
The food was great, the staff eager and attentive
We will definitely go back and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine steak
I have to say the place was awesome
The steak melted in my mouth
The atmosphere was truly NY Steakhouse
It doesn't get much better than this
I'd say it's like Sparks with super models Go you won't be disappointed
As good as it gets - - -Great food in a great looking restaurant
The service and the food exceeded my expectations
The most pleasant surprise was the atmosphere - starting with the crowd - there were 10's walking around everywhere!! I'll be back and be sending all my friends there - do yourself a favor and do the same
While the Steak was good
Seafood dishes were weak The service was very, very inexperienced, and the wine list had many overpriced mediocre bottles
I went there with a few friends and will return
The happy hour is so cheap, but that does not reflect the service or the atmosphere
We had so much fun dancing and having 2 for 1 margaritas, I also got a chance to work on my pool game
To the owners; good job guys, this place is a keeper!
The waitstaff was friendly, which really set up for a relaxing atmosphere
The food was great, I left with a delightfully full stomach
You get to smoke on the patio, which is why I went in the first place
The margaritas and music are great
Definitely will (and can afford to) go again!
Comfortable, friendly atmosphere
Clean, home-made southwestern style food
Cute outdoor patio, great tunes
In Short The tiny menu includes assorted hamburgers French fries and shakes
Fries are cut on the premises, and burgers made to order, making this place a far cry from the typical chain burger
The small, well-lit establishment draws a college crowd that loves the bargain prices and doesn't mind the paucity of frills
Um, if anyone ever tells you that Blue 9 is like In-N-Out
they're lying
BADLY
I'm from Arizona (the second place to get In-N-Out, and I've been to the original one in Cali), and In-N-Out basically DESTROYS Blue 9
I mean sure, if you want a $3 burger moderately quickly, it's a good place to go (especially for college kids), but other than that
The burger is pretty bland, the sauce isn't too flavorful, plus watery iceberg lettuce and tomatoes

The fries were pretty unexciting as well, and tasted as though they'd been sitting out for a while
(but it looked like they had just finished a new batch for the couple of people after us, so it may have been a fluke)
I will admit though, the chocolate shake was quite yummy (not as good as In-N-Out's though
)
Still, to use In-N-Out and Blue 9 in the same sentence is tastelessly insulting to In-N-Out
These guys do a great job bringing the California style burger to NY
Everything about the food is great but its too bad they had to hire the Wendy's reject staff to run the place
First, the staff could care less about you, your food and the cleanliness of the place
They do care about making sure they all spend as much time in the back room as possible to talk and ignore those waiting to order

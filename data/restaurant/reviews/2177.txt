The waiter chose my path for me and he was spot on
Absolutely delicous
The experience was a dream
End to end, we had a great evening
I cannot wait to return
BEST WINE VALUE IN NYC , FOOD QUALITY AT BEST , PROFESSIONAL SERVICE, NO CLOWNS
i went to sparks on a windy night with my friend ro (the man)
it was a wonderful experience
we dined on juicy, succulent steak that made me feel quivery inside
it was so nice
even the waiter was warm and cordial, and, need i mention, very handsome
come to sparks for wonderful decor, great steak and a beautiful night
if u come
ull be treated like a king and u will love the decor  sincerely yours  diesel
I went to Sparks and there steak is unbelievable
I love steak, and their sirloin was just unbelievable
I really couldn't belive how good it was
The wine list is also deep with a ton of choice
great place!
The steaks are great and the place just feels like a steakhouse
Nothing wrong, like in iin Rome
My waiter was a bit gruff but was very attentive
The steaks were done to perfection and the sides were perfect
Place was jammed with a business crowd but that's what i expected
Wine list was priced right and offerd plenty of great values
according to the maitre'd
After being in business for so long, you would think that they could figure out how to take and keep reservations
But apparently not
There are plenty of fine establishments in this city that usher diners in with a warm welcome, seat them promptly and apologize when tables are over 30 minutes late
Not at Sparks
Despite the rough start, the service with dinner was excellent
The waiter was very attentive and the food was great
Make sure to get the hash browns to soak up the yummy steak juices
Hands down the best dining experience I have ever had
From the moment we stepped in to the moment we stepped out, we were treated wonderfully
The staff was so friendly and gracious, they even came by our table a few times to chit chat with us
The setting is magnificent, the quality is perfect
As for the food, what can I say, I have never ate steak so extraordinary
$40 for a steak and worth every penny
High class is the best way to describe Sparks
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it
Perfect, just perfect
This is not a fine dining experience
this is a blast of a time, with no attitude and delicious food
The steak is tender, the spinach is creamy, and the service is fine to great
Bring your friends, drink some wine, even party
This is what New York City is all about baby!
The steaks are great and the wine list is unmatched in other NYC steakhouses
My husband and I live in Denver, but try to get to NYC a couple times a year and everytime we visit Sparks and have never been disappointed
The steaks are cooked to perfection, the service wonderful (although the wait staff is not overly friendly) and the wine list is unbelievable
We always make reservations, and have never had to wait
For anyone who loves steak this is an absolute must!!!!!
I don't know about the other posts and why people waited so long, but we were sat 30 seconds after we arrived and the maitre d was nice, and it was crowded on a Thursday
The service was A+ and he told us to sit and enjoy our dessert and there was absolutely no rush on anything
If there is anything better in the world than their 3 lamb chops, then i'd love to know about it
This place was great
Great steak, excellent menu
The desserts are also excellent
If you want to see a restaurant full of typical New Yorkers, this is the place
The restaurant is huge, and busy
I have eaten at Sparks for years and I have to say there has yet to be another steak house in the city that can do it any better
The steaks as well as the other entrees are always served to perfection
If for any reason someone was unsatisified they have always bent over backwards to please the customer
I am very dissapointed to see that several other steak house have been rated above sparks and it only proves that most people have no idea what they are eating or talking about
You do have to wait, regardless of a reservation, but it was only about 20 minutes and that is par for the course in the city
The filet came out charred and one side was not edible
There aren't any mashed potatoes-they are more like hash browns
The spinach was cold and had to be sent back
My boyfriend had been there several times and it had always been superb, but this was my first time and I don't want to go back
Not sure why this is supposed to be THE place: (1) meat is great, but only 2 premium cuts (filet and sirloin, and these are not everyone's favorites); (2) even if you have reservation, you'll have to wait 20 minutes; (3) lousy side dishes; (4) people who don't love filet or sirloin won't be happy -- other food is diner quality ($39
95 crab and scallop entree was clearly frozen and stuck under broiler); (5) service was not good, which is expected at steakhouses, but adds to negatives; (5) they poured our pre-meal pilsners into white wine glasses; and (6) prices are high
It's a good steak, but you could get just as good at other fine restaurants in NYC for same price with a better all-around experience
Unless you really want the saloon atmosphere and you care less about food, wine, and service, don't buy the hype
Great steaks, great service and great wines
This a true New York Steakhouse and one of the best
Everytime I come here I have and amazing steak experience
Thank God for Business Expenses
definiatly top tier for their food and service
we were seated at a table with the most intimate of settings
also, dont forget about what happened outside of this famous steakhouse all those years ago with the mob, so much so, that they had to repave the concrete outside! so interesting! great flavor also
This place is definitely heavy on the wallet, but it is worth every penny
The steak is amazing, the portions are huge, the atmosphere is lively and great for people watching and the service is exceptional
I wasn't sure what to expect as far as seating was concerned but I had a reservation and was seating within 5 minutes without have to pay off the host
It was well worth the money and I highly recommend it
So many BAD things about this restaurant - I don't know where to start: 1}The Maitre D' might as well have had a sign around his neck saying 'TIP ME, TIP ME, TIP ME
OR YOU WON'T BE SEATED'
He was arrogant and unwelcoming and was only civil if you gave him money
2} We had a 7:30 reservation and (since we didn't give him money) we were seated just before 9:00 without any apology
3} The menu/selection was typical steak house, nothing special (not even the steaks)
4} The food was average, nothing special
Absolutely none of the dishes warrant their prices
MOST IMPORTANTLY, 5} Women without men should NOT go to Sparks
I've never seen women treated with more disregard or less courtesy
Shame on them
Sparks serves up the best steak in NYC
The dry-aged sirloin is out of this world
Make a reservation, especially on weekends as the place gets packed and your chances of getting a table without a reservation are nearly impossible
Sometimes there is a wait even with a reservation so be patient and have a drink in the bar
Hands down the best steak in NYC
The shirmp cocktail is awesome

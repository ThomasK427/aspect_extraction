The service was precise and the space was comfortable
Red Hook might not have much but from Liberty Heights to BWAC to 360, it's a great excursion in Brooklyn
They were out of the chicken and the oysters by 7:00 - when there are only three entrees on the prix fixe menu, this cuts down the choices a lot
Food was good but we were forgotten after we finished our entrees
Also, the CASH ONLY policy left us without money to get a cab back -- not that there were any cabs to be found
The food was excellent last night for the dine in Brooklyn Prix fixe dinner
For 19 you got a three course meal
I had the skate with baby bok choi and the rice pudding for dessert was marvelous
We had some really wonderful wines off the extensive wine list
The Corbieres and the Saint Chinian wines were wonderful
The waiter was friendly and the owner came by and talked with us in french for a while - I think he is from Alsace Lorraine
All in all a wonderful evening
excellent food, imaginative desserts, interesting wine list in an extremely relaxed atmosphere
very casual, laid back setting -- not romantic, but extremely homey and comfortable
a wonderful neighbourhood haunt
I gotta say the food here is wonderful
Simple, classic, elegant fare at a very affordable price
I have been very impressed on both of my visits
On asking for assistance with pairing the wine to the food, I have never been mislead
All were very good
Just don't be suprised if the bottle you ordered with your first course is not available by the second
I suspect they may be going for high quality wines available only in small batches
They are always helpful with another suggestion, though
Service is decent but can on occasion be brusk
On the other hand, you never feel like they are in your face all the time
One drawback is the complete lack of any temperature control in the place
It can be unbearable on very hot or cold days
Finally, order the Chocolate Fondant, if available
It was fabulous
You would think we'd been granted an audience with the Queen
They deigned to seat us 5 minutes early for our 7 o'clock reservation (8 was simply not possible) and near the toilet despite the availability of many other tables
Then they proceeded to cram what otherwise could have been a tasty, three-course meal into 45 minutes! We were rushed and ignored
No one bothered to ask if we were enjoying our food or whether or not we wanted more to drink (we apparently needed to be out by 8)
They took our plates and deposited the check on our table without asking
Oh, and the touted creme brulee? Cold and small
The value is not worth the journey, the attitude and the indigestion
A nightmare visit -- shockingly bad
Cold draft freezes your feet as you are greeted by overloud Bjork remixes
The staff slouches on your table with both arms and brings your entree: tilefish
It's red and raw
Send it back to the kitchen
You consider amputating your toes its so cold
Poached Pears? Out of the can
Creme Brulee? Like Jello Pudding
Deeply disappointing
I have discovered my new favorite place! The atmosphere is a perfect blend between casual and intimate with great lighting, and the menu is inventive and inexpensive
The wine list is great and most bottles are around $25
I had spanish mackerel with a potato and carrot puree and creme brulee for dessert
YUM
My friends and I had a lovely time at 360
The prix fixe is an exceptional value and the food was excellent
I had no problem making reservations
In addition to our waiter, the owner came by our table several times; to ask if we had questions about the menu, to explain the types of cheese on my friend's cheese plate, and, after the meal, to ask how things were
He personally called a car service for us when we were ready to leave
The limited menu allows them to focus their efforts on well-produced meals
Although I requested an 8 res, they gave us 8:30 (ok so far)
When we arrived at 8:20 they told us the res was for 8 and they had just given our table away
We waited
Our friends, driving from the city, called because they were lost and the same manager was utterly obnoxious as if he couldn't fathom not being able to find his fabulous restaurant (in desolate Red Hook)
Food was fine, and relatively inexpensive except for a WAY overpriced cheese plate
The novelty of eating upscale bistro food in this nabe was not worth the ride or the hassle
Increedible value, 3 courses $20 price fixe(menu changes everyday), organic seldom seen wines all around $20
Small, very cute space
Lots of fun and great food
The Scene Around a curtained corner in the posh Le Parker Meridien, a neon burger sign points the way to the city's secret obsession
Suits, tourists and foodies pack this crowded hole-in-the-wall, where names are scrawled on the walls next to kid's drawings and movie posters
Even though it's decorated like a regular's hangout, no one does--the few coveted booths are hovered over shamelessly
The Food So what if orders are strung from a flimsy clothesline--the system works, and you better not slow it down
Thankfully, a succinct menu leaves little to ponder--and, despite the high churn, burgers always arrive as specified
The hard-working grill leaves its flame-flavored stamp on every morsel, and cheeseburgers get two types of cheddar for added effect
Complete the experience with an order of shoestring fries that arrive in a grease-stained paper bag, and don't miss the moist but not overly sweet cocoa brownies
burgers and fries are tasty but nothing extraordinary
so keep your expectations low, otherwise you may get dissapointed
the price you will need to pay is okay when compared with the quality of what you are offered
I just went yesterday (7-7-06) around 1pm
The line seemed long but we waited about 10 minutes
I was so excited to eat there because it's been rated one of the top burgers in NYC
You couldn't believe how excited and giddy I was while waiting on line
Once we got to the door, you basically stare at people while they eat so ur the first to grab the table when they get up
It seats 40, I counted
But not pleasantly
We did get a table, 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 drinks, and a brownie
It was good, but not the best
And I would never go back
Mcdonalds wins
Popped in 11 last night for some FOOOOD
What I got was a nice, juicy burger
I don't like bloody beef so i ordered it medium which was perfect
Ask for the works, not sure what's in it but it tasted great
Fries are okay but, on the bland side
Soda and beer is also served
I was told to avoid the milkshakes
The decor of the restaurant is the rebel, broke younger brother when compared to the grand hall of the Meridien but when it's late and you crave some good food, good atmosphere and a lot of night owls out like you, stop by here
BTW, it is Cash only
It was fun locating this place with the help of a neon burger sign when inside the hotel
Hole in the wall comes to mind, literally
Waiting on line for the burger did set my expectations high
When I unwrapped the burger, I was not impressed
Reminded me of something whipped up at someone's bbq
The taste didn't scream I need to return for more

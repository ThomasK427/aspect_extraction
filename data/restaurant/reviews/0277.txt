Whether I order the nights special or a standard from the menu or even something Ive never tried before I know Im in for a treat
Lou Lou is still the best in Fort Greene and maybe all of Brooklyn
The menu reads first class, but the food isn't
For a fairly expensive meal you should get tried and tested recipes, but they're not
Great ambience though, love the old wood decor
During the week this place was quiet, you pretty much had the whole place to yourself
The food was good not spectacular
The Scene The original Los Pollitos is a takeout joint in Sunset Park; this Slope spin-off presents an expanded but similarly inexpensive menu in slightly more decorous surroundings
It's a takeout joint, too, but has candlelit tables set up across from the stainless-steel counter
The more than gracious waitstaff win you over with their obvious pride: They know this is a special place
The Food The long menu offers standard Mexican dishes, executed with rarely seen care and skill
Bypass tacos and burritos in favor of gorditas--swollen corn tortillas, covered with tomatillo salsa and rich cream
South American additions to the menu, like perfectly fried green plantains and garlicky pork, are uniformly successful
The crowning achievement is the roast chicken, which attracts crowds from all over the city
I was there on Cinco de Mayo, the place was so crowded, but they were still able to accommodate everyone
Everyone seemed happy
The atmosphere was nice, the weather was beautiful so we sat outside
The food was delicious, I had the chicken breast in lime sauce, excellent choice, especially if you like garlic
The Margaritas were tasty, I perfer the ones on the rocks
I will definetely return to Los Pollittos II
Growing up in the southwest, Mexican has always been my favorite cuisine
(Is it really a cuisine?) I favor greasy, spicy Tex-Mex, though, and could care less about sour cream and spinach tortillas
(If you like Cal-Mex burrito shops, good riddens to you
) If you like enchiladas, tacos, tostadas, chicken mole, etc
, Los Pollitos is the jackpot at the end of the long rainbow that is the search for Mexican food in NY
Unfortunately though, Los Pollitos fails -- along with every Mexican place in NY -- to put together a solid combination of rice and beans (why is this?!?), but their main dishes are great
This is the best Mexican food I've encountered in Brooklyn, though I must emphasize the encountered in Brooklyn qualification
I'm still a long way from home, Toto
Even though Los Pollitos doesn't have the real tacos al pastor, it has pretty good ones
The choriqueso is the best as well
It is a good place to go and have fun if you like mexican food
The service is good as far as I know
Pretty good mexican!
I am very happy they opened a place on Myrtle Ave! Being from Texas I have found it hard to find anything close to the food I have had down south
The guacamole is great and the drinks are fantastic
The waitstaff was very nice as well
It is definately worth the trip
The first time we ate here my husband and I (plus kids) were not impressed
Then we tried a simple take out of chips and salsa and guacamole
who could mess that up? Los Pollitos did! They did not make the guacamole fresh; they scooped it out of a big bucket
When we asked for it fresh, they said we would get a smaller portion which was much smaller then the portion we had recieved the 1st time we visited
And they wouldn't sell us the salsa at the table
only pico de gallio
They did all this AFTER they ran our credit card and absolutely refused to comply with our request
The manager would not make it right for us
All we wanted was the same treatment as if we stayed to eat
Avoid this place
Admittedly, this is a rant about poor service
The food was okay
My wife ordered an iced tea
It was so rank and undrinkable - not just a little bit off, but tasting like someone had added Mr
Clean to the glass - that we sent it back
The waiter refused to make a fresh batch
He also refused to remove it from the bill
As did the manager
We were polite, at first
Perhaps something was lost in translation
I tried to impress on the manager that the iced tea was undrinkable
He kept asking if I wanted to see the menu
I have never done this before
I finally told him that I'd like to see where on the menu it indicated that the food was bad and the service was worse
You can do so much better in Park Slope, avoid this place if you can
The food is delicious (and I'm not a big fan of Mexican, so that means a lot coming from me), the sangria is absolutely yummy, and the outdoor seating area is great for summer nights
The service is very friendly
I would definately come here again and again
Los Pollitos is by far the best Mexican in the Slope, and among the best in the city
The soft tacos are delicious: well balanced flavors, real Mexican cheese (no monterey jack here), and made with care
What's more, they're huge
Burritos are similarly great
I haven't tried the chicken but people I know who have always rave about it
The staff is gracious, it's relaxed, and the prices are more than reasonable
Love it!
Made the trip hoping to finally find some good Tex-Mex, but came away disappointed
I'll qualify my review by noting that I just returned from South Texas where I ate the real deal
In comparison, Pollitos was just okay
For most people that have never eaten the authentic stuff, this should be fine
I had the chicken w/mole and would not recommend it
The beans were good though, I'll give them that
Park Slopers tend to rave about Los Pollitos, and I'm not quite sure why
I like to support my neighborhood businesses, and the people that work at the restaurant have been nice, but the food just isn't that great
Maybe it's just the vegetarian dishes that are lacking; after all, the restaurant is named for its chicken! But I don't eat meat, and despite the wonderful smells wafting out from Los Pollitos whenever I pass by, I've been disappointed every time I decide to give it one more shot
The sopes are tasteless, the enchiladas are boring, and the portions are small
I can say they've got some good--if expensive--guacamole, though!
Do not let the outside decor stop you from going in
Once you go on, the restaurant is a gem
The waitors are attentive, the food is soooo good-- must try the flan and pork (tender and juicy) and the regular nachos
The best mexican restaurant by far!!!! The prices are inexpensive, too
Sangria is only ok but still yummy
the tacos are alright
but only alright, nothing special, the only real star that i've tasted was the chicken, which deservs mention for its cheapness
the encaladas are awful though, and one of the sauces (its a chocolate based sauced) tasted like either it had been burnt or sitting in the pot for the entire day
Yum, the chicken is great here
Get a whole one for $8, a side of rice and beans, a side of plantains and a couple of salads and you got a dinner for 2 for about $15
00! The guac is fresh, yet lacking flavor, we like to add our fresh salsa into it
I'd like more choices of sauce for the chicken, but the tasty green sauce they serve with it is spicy and light
I did have to revise this review after I tasted more of the dishes here
The fajita we tried was tasteless and burned and the mole sauce was way too sweet
Stay with the roasted chickens and you'll be fine
This is a good place to order from when you have guests at your house
Just get 2 of the rotesserie chickens and a few sides and you're set

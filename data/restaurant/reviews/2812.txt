The rum raisin, banana, butter pecan and walnut are some of the finest ice creams on earth, and are lavishly accentuated with freshly made whipped cream and thick, gooey syrups of all flavors, including pineapple, butterscotch and hot fudge
The egg creams are average, but the malts and milkshakes put all others to shame
And, if you can stomach it, the triple-scoop banana sundae will bring you back to a time in your life when chocolate ice cream was your main raison d'etre
For ice cream officionados and children of all ages, Eddies is worth a trip from anywhere
The ice cream is always fresh and creamy, with fruits tasting like they should--like themselves
The chocolate is rich and delicious
A great touch is the when the bowl of homemade whipped cream is pulled from a refrigerator to be used in topping a hot fudge sundae--nothing industrial or canned here
A basic sandwich/burger menu is also served for pre-ice cream nourishment--just always remember to leave room for dessert!!!
I've been reading about this place for a long time, and I hear nothing but good things
So, finally, I decided to go there, and I'm so happy that I did
The best ice cream sundaes and banana splits, EVER!!! I even work out harder in the gym, just so I can come here as often as I can
Eddie's is the BEST experience you will ever have when it comes to ice cream
I have been going here since I was 2
now that I'm 22 I still wouldnt change my mind about this place
The ice cream is all fresh and homemade and they are the only place in New York who have a special license to make their own special whipcream and it's the fluffiest, creamiest, and lightest thing in the world!! the toppings are to die for, the ice cream is rich, flavorful, and delicious!! There's a reason it's been around forever and always will be
because it's the real thing
maybe SOME people are used to imitation and processed things, and thats why when they have the real best thing they dont realise that's how it SHOULD taste
too bad for you because that means more for the rest of us! :)
Eddie's Sweet Shop has been around since I was a little girl and I am 42 years old
My brothers and I went to school with his kids
Everything is homemade inside
Not only the ice cream
My girl friends and I would go to the Cinemart Movie theater across the street and then go to Eddie's sweet shop for dessert
It should be a landmark!
Eddie's is a Forest Hills institution
Homemade ice cream and whipped cream are served in an ice cream parlor straight out of the '50s
It's great
Sit at the counter and watch as they make magic
I love the old refrigerator with the huge bowls of homemake whipped cream
They make their own ice cream
Coffee chip is incredible, but then again so is the banana, maple walnut and all the other flavors
FORGET aerosol whip cream
They bring out huge bowls of fresh whipped heavy cream for sundaes and ice cream sodas
Don't even think about your diet!!!
In Short A late-night crowd orders miniature burgers by the sackful at this castle-shaped Midwestern chain restaurant
The menu is short and sweet: hamburgers, cheeseburgers and double cheeseburgers, with all-beef patties steam-grilled on a pile of onions and served on square white buns with pickles
Extras like bacon and jalapeno cheese are also available, as well as non-burger options like fried chicken or fish sandwiches and sides of fries, onion rings and cheese sticks
White Castle is your perfect late-night burger place
Feeling hungry on your way back from a late Yankee or Met game? Stop at White Castle -- it's good food, fast
You Gotta Feed the Crave!! These White Castle hamburgers are just absolutely the best to fix that crave
at all hours too since it is open 24 hours!!! I'm from L
A
and wish we had White Castle's
it's super cheap
and soooo filling
=) I could eat four in one sitting
mmmmmm
but the cheeseburger was not as great
Hamburger is a great price for under 50 cents!!!
Nice place to hang out and grab some pinoy snacks
Try their Sans Rival
It's wonderful
The food is close to typical Filipino food in comparison to establishments in Manhattan
Pretty cheap as well
The only problem is that whenever it gets too busy, the wait for the food is really really long, and sometimes the waiters can get grouchy
A lot of seating though, especially upstairs where one can watch Filipino shows on a big screen or on several tv monitors throughout the floor
Staff members speak Tagalog fluently too, so it makes the atmosphere more authentically Pinoy (Filipino)!
Decent, cheap and authentic Mexican restaurant
Would return and recommend
fish is excellent with the light tomato sauce
both veal and chicken parms are excellent
light and appetizing, not the pizzeria heavy handed fare
At lunch the service is very good
I must admit the times my family (6 or more) have had dinner there the service seemed to forget us after serving the main course
This is why my daughter loves tipping the bus boys because they tend to be more attentive
I have eaten @ IL many times and never have been disappointed with a meal
I just wish the waiter service was a bit more attentive
It's a small liitle out of the way restaurant but the food is outrageous
The girls are great, service is quick and so worth the wait
Their salmon in garlic sauce is fantastic
Love the Tavern, It's a neighborhood bar - they don't serve food, but they have the nicest people working and hanging out there
Izalco is small and cozy with a very friendly staff who provides excellent service
Their pupusas and tamales are very delicious
My bf and I discovered it last year and we try to go back once a month
It's a must try!
The Stop Inn features the most decadent omelette I've ever encountered, with black white pudding, rasher and cheese built right in, plus a side of the most ethereal hash browns I've ever encountered
Entirely worth the eventual coronary
I think the food served here is average of quality, though they serve a good amount to even take a doggy-bag home
I don't know what that guy what talking about, I kissed like four hot Irish guys within 20 minutes of entering the place! And did I mention the free drinks? I could have left my wallet at home that night! Beware of the nerdy American guys there, they're the place's only downfall
Word up
Kilmegan is a warm, friendly place
The restaurant is wonderful (the mashed potatoes are to die for), the bar staff are quick and friendly, there are TVs for match-watching and the live music is usually good when they have it
The Scene This is the kind of Thai food some consider unattainable in Manhattan
The atmosphere is squeaky clean and no-nonsense: Tables for two can be pushed together to accommodate groups--if there's room
There's a strict no-reservations policy, but even when the weekend line goes out the door, the vibe stays happy and laid-back
The Food A good way to judge a Thai spot is by its green curry: The all-Thai staff here fashions it spicy and smooth, filled to bursting with meat and thin-sliced bamboo shoots
Shrimp papaya salad could set you on fire, but not everything is spicy
Chicken-coconut soup strikes a good balance between sour and the raw, gingery taste of galangal
A heat-bearing rice noodle dish is chock-full of basil and chili-flecked ground pork succulent enough to be called creamy
Even the coconut rice--simultaneously moist and fluffy--transcends boundaries
We saw our waitress twice the whole night
She didn't speak english, didn't apologize for our extended wait to eat, and pretended not to see us when we signaled her from across the room
Our water glasses were actually refilled until some of our meal finally showed up at which point we never were offered another drop (or anything else for that matter)
The first food to arrive took over an hour to make it from the kitchen to our table
And this was with a half empty restaurant
Even the curry and rice took an hour to arrive from the kitchen, go figure
But maybe they brought the whole meal at once and that's why it took so long? Not at all
half our meal didn't arrive for another 30 minutes after the curry (that's an hour an a half total)
All the Thai families around us, even those seated well after us, received their food long before us
As every review has stated already, the food here is top notch

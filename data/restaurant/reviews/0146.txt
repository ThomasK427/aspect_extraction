Then, when we wanted to leave, the waiter ignored us continuely as we asked for the bill
Finally, we just left, soaked with red wine, without paying
I ate here with a few friends and had the worst time of my life
horrible service, unapologetic waiter for mishap, so cramped i got knocked in the head a few times by patrons walking through with big bags
desserts were good
I wish that people would stop thinking that every good review must be written by staff of the restaurant! I am in no way affiliated with Max and I sing its praises every chance I get
The food is excellent and very moderately priced! The only things I would complain about are that the service varies between a little too fast to snail's-pace-slow, and the wine list seems to be a little pricey in comparison to the menu prices
The atmosphere is ecclectic as no one table or chair seems to be the same, but that's half the fun of this place
Go, eat and enjoy
at these prices, you don't have much to lose
The description like mom used to make is pretty accurate
Mom's food is always great, but she is also not a five star chef
The food here is good, hearty and simple, though I would not say particularly outstanding or interesting/inventive
What they do, they do well
Further, the atmosphere is nice and laid back
Go here for quality homestyle dishes, and you won't be disappointed
I am always a fan of the Ravioli of the Day, but don't forget to try the homemade gnochi, which comes with plenty of mozzerella
The food at this restaurant is NOT yummy
I have eaten here twice and tried differant dishes and whoever is writing these fabulous reviews must be working there and trying to promote it
I think their back bar is popular but that would be the only reason to go here
The food is tasty--very much like homecooked food
Everything on the menu is good and their specials are inventive
The waiters are cute and have sexy italian accents
Very casual which is nice if you just want to drop by
You can't beat the prices for such good quality
I have tried every pasta dish and I can't say a negative thing about their food
Now that it has a name for itself, Max has really let its food quality go downhill
The first time we went the dishes were yummy and the meat sauces were meaty
When we went a few months later, the sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee and we couldn't tell the meat sauce from the vegetarian
Perhaps their former cook quit
I just can't help to note that too many of Max's reviews strongly sound as the were written by their staff itself
Despite this little feeling I must agree that the place is not bad and the food really affordable
Just I don't find it to be so much the top of the top as somebody writes
also considering that you literally eat elbow to elbow with the stranger next to you and you are delivered the check while still eating the maincourse (I swear once it happened during my appetizer time!!!) in order to make room for the next fellows to come
The menus at the downtown and the uptown (Max Soha) restaurants are the same, and the food at both spots is absolutely delicious
Of the two, I prefer Max Soha for its more sophisticated atmosphere
the food is amazing and won't hurt your wallet either
but keep this place a secret, because once people find out about it you'll never be able to get a table
The most enduring quality that Max had to offer was the outdoor dining in the middle of alphabet city
We were seated promptly and the wait staff was very attentive and service oriented
The house chianti was a little too dry and I would not recommend it
However, the spaghetti in lamb sauce was fantastic
this place was hopping in the middle of the week, with birthday parties, groups and couples
too bad the bar area is so small because they really pack them in here
decent Italian food at a good price
extensive wine list also--would definitely go back
I recommend this place
They have a great patio which would be perfect for a group
The food is very simple but good
Nice basic Italian at amazingly low cost
Lamb ragu is good
Just be prepared to wait--and to dine crammed elbow to elbow with weekend East Village party-crashers
The Scene Though it's at the back, the fantastic bricked open kitchen steals the show
Its visible wood-burning oven fills the place with the scents of Italy
The restaurant is a neighborhood favorite; cozy dates, ladies on a girls night out, and plenty of regulars fill the space nightly
Don't let the all-Italian menu intimidate; the waitstaff patiently translates each item
Service is friendly, but timing can be off
The Food Chef-owner Frank De Carlo's cooking shines, from appetizer to dessert
Do not miss the creamy, heavenly fresh burrata when it's a special, and the addictive spicy octopus is another table pleaser
The pasta is superb: The tender gnocchi melts in the mouth and the perfectly al dente pasta, topped with langoustine, has just the right amount of spice
The lush risotto (changed seasonally) is another winner
End with the lighter-than-air panna cotta
Very unfortunate , this was one of the best restaurants in town in my mind
I have had everything on the menu over the last 3 years and I have to say my last three visits just bad!!!
The sarde is still ok the service was just ok
and just the whole experience and quality of the food was not worth the price
(prochetta was not great
used to be great)  The Matre'd and hostess are very arrogant and cold
Go somewhere else
like Babbo
much more professional and quality of food much higher for the same price
I went here for a graduation dinner with my whole family--grandparents, parents, and aunts and uncles
Everyone was happy with everything, nuff said
My family shares dishes, so I ate six different things on the menu, and all of them
The portions are medium sized
It was an incredible meal, and our server was a really upbeat person
The gnocci was absolutely fantastic
Although I didn't pay for the meal (and it's about $22 bucks a plate, way over my normal eating range), I have to say that it was better than any food I've ever had in little Italy, and there weren't any touristy elements to be found
SOHO eating at its finest
I ate at Peasant last nite and had the most wonderful dinner
Most of the time when I go out to eat I wish I had stayed home and cooked dinner myself
It was definetly NOT the case at Peasant, everything was perfect and there is no way I could ever make any of the food at home
The chef is a real genius
We started out at the bar at had a fabulous time with Aaron the bartender and his delicious Pomegranate Martinis
The bar was packed to the rim and he still managed to treat us as though we were the only ones there! The ambiance is beautiful with the open kitchen and its rustic charm
I want to eat at Peasant every nite!
I went out to dinner with some friends last night and was feeling kind of grumpy (bad day, long story)
The last thing I wanted 2 do was try somewhere I've never been B4, but I went to Peasant anyway to please my buds
WHAT A SURPRISE! From the moment we walked in the door the lovely hostess greeted us warmly seated us in the cozy and sleek lounge while we waited just a few minutes for our table
The bartender approached us shortly afterwards with kind enthusiasm
His name was Aaron and I think my girlfriend has a crush on him
We drank some great Italian wine I had never heard of and had some amazing homemade breadsticks and olives
Dinner was gorgeous, special and I can't stop dreaming about the rissoto
To think I didn't want to eat here! I plan to go back to Peasant soon and eat more than my words
We just found our new best Italian restaurant Peasant
From the moment we walked we could smell the beautiful aromas from the kitchen
We were promptly seated at our table and the waiter translated our menus which were in Italian
The only problem is we wanted to order everything on the menu
We going back next time with more of our friends just to do that
We had the octopus to start which was baked in the wood fire oven it was so good and the pizza magarita which is the best we ever had

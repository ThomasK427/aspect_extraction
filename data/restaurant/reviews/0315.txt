Usually seated right away
Great presentation
I keep on coming back
Went there early with my girlfriend and enjoyed a wonderful dinner
The food was delicious but one thing I didn't like was the fact the waitresses were staring at the patrons, maybe becasue it wasn't too busy
Not the best in the City, but a very good standby if you are in the neighborhood and don't want to spend a fortune
It won't make you swoon, but neither will you be disappointed
Personally, I love this place because so few have discovered it
The food is always good, and the service is always better
It's never a disappointment!
I used to go to the expensive sushi restaurants frequented by Japanese business men, thinking this would guarantee me the freshest, cleanest tasting raw fish
I didn't have much faith in most sushi restaurants in NYC, having had more than a few not-so-great experiences
One day a friend brought me to Misu - and I have not been to another sushi restaurant since
The fish is so fresh and clean - the pieces are just the right size
Am so glad I found this place!
Mizu is a perfect New York combination of young, trendy crowd, reasonably priced dishes and a fabulous ambience
And if that's not enough for you, just ask for Joe and he'll show you a great time!
spent my birthday at mizu last night had such a good time, i'll never go anywhere else for sushi
Found out about this place because of the rave reviews and, while the food service is a bit slow (they seem to first make the takeout orders that flow through here like a river after a monsoon), the food is truly well done and prices just right
We had only the freshest fish in all our orders of sushi and specialty rolls
My singular complaint would be that some of the rolls fell apart -- they could be made a little better, technically speaking, but tasted good nevertheless
The place is prettily done up and the vibe casual but nice
This is definitely a neighborhood gem and I look foward to coming back
I only wished I worked closer so that I could try their lunch specials -- they sound delicious and are reasonably priced!
great food and friendly service
the staff knows the regulars by name and the sushi chef even yells goodbye from behind the bar
My friend, alex, thought the tuna was phenomenal
The red bean fried ice cream rocks
I am in love
Try it
Amazing
Beside being the best tasting the color and presentation is simply artistic! Definitely my favorite Sushi spot in the city!
I can't say enough how much I LOVE this place
I've been t Nobu, Yama, and all those others and this is the most consistent, high quality sushi for your buck
The Yuki and Shrimp Tempura rolls are always the best, and Joe the manager is definitely one of the attractions
He gets to know all the regulars and always greets me with a smile, handshake, and an occasional story or two
If you haven't tried it, definitely go
It's a keeper
I LOVE MIZU! The fish is SO FRESH and cut generously! I go at least once a week
The chefs, the manager Joe and the waiting staff are superb! It's an overall wonderful package
The biggest bang for the buck in NYC
I've been to Nobu, Sushi Samba, Yama, etc
, but I find myself going to Mizu 9 times out of ten when I go out for sushi
The food comes out lightning fast
I've thrown parties and had romantic dinner dates there
Perfect fish, perfect sushi, perfect everytime
and the owners are the nicest!
and this was no different
I rely on reviews for sushi, because there is nothing worse than bad sushi
This place was great! Excellent Sushi, reasonable prices, fast delivery!!!
Hands down, the best value in the city
My favorite
My girlfriend and I are connoisseurs and have been to every good sushi place in NYC
Mizu rocks - great sushi, very fresh, great service! Best take out by far! But please don't go - we don't like waiting for tables
also - watch your sake - Joe will snatch it! Mr
Lee and Jay are master sushi chefs - ask for them
the sushi here is great its fresh the rolls are delicious
the service is great and the environment is friendly
ive been to a lot of sushi places but so far this is the best ive had in the city
mizu is a great place, with a simple clean home-like atmosphere
all the fish i had in their sushi/sashimi platter for 2 were fresh
the slices were generous
Go here
Sit at the sushi bar
Ask for Lee, aka Bruce Lee
You will not be disappointed as the sashimi is fresh and the rolls are creative
I was surpised a place not listed in Zagat would be this good, and the prices are right
Overall my new favorite place
Everything about Mizu's is great
The service, the food (awesome!) and their manager Joe
Its strange to find someone who actually cares that you didn't finish your sake
He offered my friend and I beer to replace the sake but as I was so stuffed from their food, I had to turn him down
He told us to have a rainchecked beer on him, chances are he won't remember me but its nice that the offer was made
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy
While their kitchen food is delicious, their Sushi is out of this world
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else
Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming
Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!
This place is ok
I went there because some people love it, but the food was below average and the service was awful
but sure
the pickles are good
Wow
Just wow
Definitely don't miss the soup
The cole slaw and pickles that arive right away are outstanding
All the food is well above par
The service is good; nothing to write home about, but they seem to stay on top of things
Even the iced tea is good
One of my favorites, and perfect for comfort food
Artie's is perfect for providing a warm fulfilling dinner
I can help it but every time I go I must have the stuffed cabbage
The portions are enormous and there are always leftovers to take home for tomorrow's lunch
The servers seem to have been there forever and are very attentive
Food comes fast and the prices are right!
Wow what cna i say first
fantastic pastrami, matzo balls and chopped liver
without any of the typical ny deli attitude
very reasonably priced and a great place for kids
i know i sound like an ad but it was awesome

don't get me wrong - sushi was good, just not fantastic
good variety but nothing surprising
SUM IT: don't read the '10's' reviews, try it to judge for yourself so you won't have as hi expectations, then you'll be sure to enjoy it
Based on the quantity of 10 ratings here, I was expecting to be bowled over by the quality at this establishment
As it happened, the quality was perfectly fine, but it wasn't remarkable in any way
Still, the rolls were tender and tasty, the ambience pleasant, and the service was good if not overly attentive
I would eat here again if I were already in the area, but wouldn't take a long subway ride to get there
This has been our fav neighborhood spot for some time
then we moved away, now we check back and the place is super crowded thanks to that NYTimes review they got in January
anyways
they managed to keep their high level of food, freshness and service
too bad that the 2 sushi chefs have become a bit too busy to chat away with the guests at the counter, but they try and hey, we are here for the food !!! If you like Unagi, go for the monster eel
The volcano roll is great too
I keep having dreams about that place
This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the city
I found it totally by pure luck, It is very easy to miss even when you walk right by it
I was seated promtly at the sushi bar
(Definitly recommend sitting at the bar - you get whole lots of goodies from the chefs)  Huge selection of fresh fish both local and exotics
I don't know if you are into cold sake like me but if you are you'll be in heaven here
Nice selection of authentic Japanese sakes not the California made with the Japanese name stuff
Well too many praises to list but not enough place, go give it a try and you won't be dissapointed
Guaranteed, I am very very picky when it comes down to raw fish, trust me
I wouldn't want to eat in any place but this is the one
Kanpai!
Great sushi place! They had a great variety and the fish was extremely fresh
We've been to a lot of sushi places in NY and we still found pieces that we've never had anyplace else! Try the bonito nigiri as its rare to find such a fresh piece elsewhere
We heard it was flown in that day from Japan
The wait staff is extremely nice but the restaurant is small so get there early before the neighborhood locals fill up the tables
Who'd expect to find perfect sushi on this block? But there it is: Tsuki's simply the best
Everything's beautifully fresh and the chefs are always striving to please and educate the palate; the Tsuki Assortment in particular is anything but the usual tired salmon-yellowtail-shrimp plate, and it usually features at least one completely unexpected item
(And whatever else you order, don't miss the Volcano Roll appetizer!) Lovely service
Be nice to them
After all, you'll be back
I finally found a great neighborhood Japanese restaurant that serves a large variety of Fresh Fish and Cold Sake
I used to go to Haru Sushi
After a while the crowd and the high prices got to me
I realized that you dont have to wait hours and pay crazy prices for food
So I started exploring my choices and I discovered Tsuki
It is almost invisible
They have a small sign outside so if you dont pass by right front of it, youll probably miss it
I gave them a try about a year ago and since then I havent been any other Japanese restaurant in New York
They carry a good selection of local and exotic fish selection and ever growing cold sake list
Try the Mutsu-Hassen, very smooth sake from Japan
If you become a regular, youll get your own wooden sake cup which you can personalize
An odd combination: Great beer variety, awful service, fun next-table neighbors
Among the oddities of the night was the menu which listed a different car with each food item
The relationship of the car to the food item was not clear
Ai and I ordered two different items that were supposed to come with different side dishes (cheese, red cabbage, sour kraut, onions, mustard)
We both got the exact same sausage: no cabbage, no sour kraut, no onions, no mustard
Because we complained, our hostile waitress brought us the sides separately, a little sour kraut and cabbage on a plate
Ai said she thinks the problem was we didn't order by car model
The waitress was hostile and incompetent
Though she did give us a discount when we complained
Our first order was potato pancakes
We waited, assuming that they had to mix the batter and fry the pancakes
then we waited, assuming they had to slice, chop, cut and dry the potatoes to make the mix that made the batter
Then we waited, figuring out they had to grow the potatoes, before they sliced, chopped and cut
Our neighbors at the next table were friendly enough, though
Natives and visitors from Raleigh NC
Nice conversation
Maybe we'll see them again
but we won't see this bar again
--Drink Club is a roving group of NYC drinkers
Of all the German restaurants in the NY metro area, why did we pick this one? It looked like a dank bar
Poorly lit, the scent of stale beer filled the air and wobbly benches
The non German staff (except the host) seemed clueless
Two people, one table, three servers
Why? We had to ask repeatedly to get our drinks and the check at the end
The seating is Hamburgisch, with table and benches with crude lighting up above
The food was nothing special though plenty of it came
The only treat was the side of red cabbage and the German beers
However, it was very inexpensive and a value for what you got
For better German food, go to Queens
Even the music's on the money here
Great selection of german shots that you'll see only in Germany
No Warsteiner but hey - you can't have everything I guess
Great authentic food! Love the Beer Hall type of atmosphere
I have been to Hallo Berlin on 10th Ave
many times and have never received anything but top-notch service
I have always found the staff to be very friendly and the food very good to excellent
My favorites are the Leberkase and the Pea Soup
fabulous! The beer selection could be more varied (like having a weizen on draught) but what they do have is quite good
The beer garden out back is a nice quiet oasis in a busy city
If you likr to be satisfied for small change
try Hallo Berlin, you can't gp wrong
If you like sitting around drinking beer with a picnic table of friends (or strangers), this is a great way to spend a day (FYI - they have a backyard Beer Garden as well)
The beer is german and the food is german
go figure
I like the Wursts and they have 8 varieties - Some boiled and some grilled but all good
I hope you have an opportunity to take advantage of this unusual dining experience
I'm surprise that no-one else coined that cliched title first
I always thought that German food sucked until I had a fantastic meal in Hamburg last year
Hallo Berlin delivered a Teutonic experience in keeping: a good variety of bratwurst and other food, in a nice facsimile of a bierhall
The food was better than the beer, which was a little watery, but if you fancy a good stein, this is a great place to go
Manager named Gerk treated us worst one can think of
He is at the 10 Ave branch
Upon denying to seat at the table near door , he told us I give the seat or else you leave
Since we wanted to have German food we went to 9th av
Everthing was good there
A real gem for the city, authentic German food and beers at half the price of any other German restaurant, but just as good!

I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood

Excellent coffees, great attention and for the summer nothing can beat the cold frapucchinos
The Scene Opened in 1976, this two-level sushi and Japanese restaurant continues to attract a hearty following of midtown professionals and business travelers
Each floor holds its own sushi bar in addition to table seating, and is decorated with spring green walls, light woods and bright, rice-paper-coated lighting
The service is professional and brisk
The Food Creatively cooked dishes occasionally outshine the raw selections
An appetizer of broiled cod marinated in sake paste offers a rare melding of delicacy and earthiness, and the crisp lily root croquettes boast a unique sweetness
Order the lovely, colorfully presented Box of Dreams, which holds nine distinct sushi tastings including a sumptuous bluefin tuna, silky Spanish mackerel and a harmonious pairing of tamago and shrimp
The chef's sushi pick of the day offers expected standards: fatty tuna is rich and sea urchin delectably creamy, but salmon and yellowtail can have a slight toughness
I really like the decor in this restaurant, and the staff is insanely friendly
EVERY member of the staff says hi to you in Japanese (which I'm not going to attempt to spell) when you walk in, and they do a great job of checking in on you without hovering
Their miso soup is outstanding, but the sushi was a little disappointing
They give you quite generous pieces of fish for the sushi which is far longer than the rice (but they could use a little more rice actually), but the salmon definitely was a little tough, the yellowtail was ok, not the best, and the eel was pretty good
The tuna was their strongest by far
Still, a good deal for the money
you get quite a lot of sushi for between $19-35 in their lunch specials
I also wanted to mention that they DO season their sushi and put QUITE a lot of wasabi on it (except it's on top of the rice and under the fish, so I didn't notice that at first
and I tend to put a lot of wasabi in my soy sauce
so I guess it goes without saying, but my first taste was kiiiind of uncomfortable), so ask them to adjust accordingly if you have a problem with that
Sit at the sushi bar for some top notch authentic sushi
I have never been disappointed
This is one of the best places in NYC for real sushi, and prices are reasonable considering the quality they serve
If I'm craving some good pieces, I would definitely come to Hatsuhana over any of the other high-end sushi restaurants in the city
When ordering the anago, get it sawa-ni style
Mouthwatering
The selection of fresh fish is great here
I've been to this restaurant about 10 times and the quality of the sushi is conistantly high
The sushi chefs that I've had have always been very skilled
Service is good, however, there have been times where communication was a problem(langauage)
With that said, the price is very steep
For a dinner of 3, with no alcohol, our bill was $450 for about 60 pieces of sushi
I haven't had the other dishes/entrees and cannot comment on the overall food of the restaurant
The place gets busy, however, never too crowded
Hatsuahana is OK, but for the same price you can go to Sushiden a short walk away and experience better food, atmosphere, and service
I tried Hatsuhana for lunch last week because Sushiden was closed, and I was generally disappointed
Sushiden has a much cleaner, spaced out feel, making its atmosphere superior
It feels like there are more staff members per customer at sushiden, and both the quality and selection at sushiden is considerably better
As stated before, the prices are very similar
It just doesn't make any sense to me to eat at Hatsuhana with the best midtown sushi restaurant a mere block or two away
I really have to hand it to Hatsuhana
No other restaurant approaches authentic sushi as passionately as they do
Despite tremendous pressure from these so called trendy and hip sushi boutiques to abandon their art change their format, Hatsuhana has preserved their concept
I admit that times have definitely changed but Hatsuhana's excellent sushi has not
They're still the only Japanese restaurant to have ever recieved four stars in the New York Times, and their sushi continues to prove why
Try their dream box it really is a dream come true!! Real smooth juicy fresh sushi!!   But their desserts were just plain
And do kno that this is a business dining place
don't expect anything hip or fun!
The food, service and ambience all make this place feel like it should be in Tokyo
except the price! Such good value for such good food is a real catch
Try ordering away from the menu (need to know what you want!) for a real non-Sushi treat
After numerous visits I continue to make the effort
Though a little pricey, this hole in the wall is classy, warm and makes delicious hot chocolate! It's just sweet and creamy enough to not be overwhelming and bitter enough to let you know you are drinking high quality cocoa
Yummy!
The cappucino and nutella crepe did things (good things) to my body that aren't suitable to write in a review
I'll just say it was a great experience, and I highly recommend it
With great fresh coffee and the best espresso I've found in NYC or anywhere outside of Italy for that matter, this place is truly authentic
It has a warm feel of a real European cafe with the Italian mosaic floor and cozy size
I love the crepes, panini grilled sandwiches and home-made gelato
A nice change from the chains that have proliferated throughout the city
The people who run this hole in the wall coffee joint are passionate about their coffee
Each day brings a new estate grown select coffee, expertly brewed
The taste is rich and flavorful, without the charred taste that others inflict
No need for cappucino
Just get a cup of the good stuff and add a dolop of cream
Coffee heaven
maybe it was because we came during restaurant week, but the food was below average
the host was unpleasant as was one of our waitresses
i ordered the sushi which was no better than sushi from the deli, my appetizer of beef wrapped with scallion was decent and the dessert of tofu flan was ok
overall though, i was extremely disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant
I am alergic to shellfish and when ordering the sushi platter I asked if they could just put some plain pieces of anything other than shellfish and they said no
It wasn't until we were about to leave that they agreed to accommodate
The service got worse as the meal went on
I'd never go back
I went here for restaurant week, and I know that means I didn't get their top dishes, but I found the food very disappointing
To make matters worse, the service was less than stellar as well
The extra $$ this places costs gets you better ambience, but the food is not much better than your local Japanese dive
Went for restaurant week, but the meniu looked so good we chose many of their little dishes instead
The shark fin on consomme pool, with egg custard made me think I was in Tokyo! Their Tai Kabuto-ni, head of Japanese snapper, simmered in broth - AMAZING! The dishes just kept coming! I wish I'd had a bigger stomach! Wonderful! I'll definately return! Delicious! To top it off, the restaurant is so spacious that you felt you had it all to yourself!
I have walked and/or ridden by this place for over 30 years and never tried it, believing hotel restaurants were limited
Recently, I was proven wrong
The food is very good, the service is exceptional and I can't believe it took me so long to get there
Try the clam appetizer!
When me and my girl friend got there around 6, it was pretty empty so we were seated right away

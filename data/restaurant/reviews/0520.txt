6 bucks will get you one of the days specials and 2 sides
These places are jammed for lunch so get on the earlier side or later side
My only gripe was that the food was all in big bins, but that's expected for a lunch rush hour type crowd
This place is truly a hidden treasure
I work 2 blocks away
I discovered the place a couple of months ago and now eat there 2-3 times a week
The food is authentic, excellent home-made Cuban
The rice is cooked and spiced to perfection (#1 test for good Cuban food !), as so are the ropa vieja, picadillo, beef onions, etc
The place is nothing fancy, but the food rivals any of the top Cuban restaurants in NYC
It' only open for lunch but the food is so good! It's about $7 for lunch and they have take-out or dine-in
It gets very crowded so I would suggest that you get their early
Food is excellent and they also have empenadas and plaintains which are good for an afternoon snack
i work in this area and i stopped in to get an order to go
i got rice beans roast pork (cuban style)
it came out to $7
i thought it was a bit pricey for a take out place, but noticed that a LOT of ppl were lined up for the food, so it must be good, i thought
well, it was
the roast pork was very flavorful and juicy
will definitely go back to try out some of the other stuff
Wonder little restaurant with a passionate owners/family influence
I high recommed it for 2-4 people who appreciate good food and service
I hope you will patronize Pinocchio and keep it in business
Thanks
My wife and I found Pinocchio's a few months ago and gave it a try
We enjoyed the food and the service so much that we are in the process of bringing everyone we know to this small but excellent little gem
Definitely give this place a try - you will not be disappointed
I was so worried about trying a new place out
All I have been doing this past week is reading city search reviews on Italian places
If you want a place that is not all hyped up and commercial like many of the places in NYC are starting to get like; this place is it
Food was amzing and the service impeccable
I am also a hard critic being that my father is a chef and born in Italy
The owner is so charming and even made a special dish that i had requested! Price was very reasonable
I can say that it was the best experience i have had at an Italian restaurant in NYC
Def check it out
good for a date or ven for a group
This is the best Northern Italian in the city
The host is very welcoming
service is outstanding
The food is delicious; every meal I'v had has been wonderful
The atmosphere is very cozy, with a tin ceiling, narrow dining room, and low lighting
Great food, good wine and an excellent host
Mark the owner is very accommodating
I have been to the establishment several times and have never been dissapointed
Highly reccomend Pinocchio
I took my boyfriend to Portofino Grille on a Friday night and had a pleasant but cliched experience
The interior of the restaurant is meant to reflect an Italian outdoor dining area and the cheesy lamps and starlit ceiling reminded me of a Disney World restaurant
sweet but a bit too idealized
Our waitress did not take our drink order until I finally flagged her down and even then she seemed disinterested in our meal
Two plates of antipasti and bread were placed before us which was a nice touch
Our appetizer of roasted peppers and mozzarella was below average
I ordered a simple baked ziti which was medicore; my boyfriend raved about his seafood ravioli
If you're craving any sort of Italian, Portofino will do
However, if you're looking for truly fabulous food, I wouldn't recommend
I recently went to Portofino and was completely taken aback by how beautiful and cozy the restaurant is
The wine list and bread were excellent, but I was not overly impressed with my meal (and neither was my boyfriend)
As someone who has tasted true Italian food in Italy, I would say that Portofinos take is below average, especially to some other Italian restaurants in NYC
I had a chicken dish and my boyfriend had the vealmaybe the pasta is better? Go for the ambience, but steer clear of the complicated looking dishes
Portofino Grille is quite possibly my favorite Italian restaurant
The atmosphere is charming and brings back memories of dining in Venice
The food is incredible and the selection is unbeatable
Service deserves high marks and the prices are below what one would expect to pay for perfection
If you are looking for an excellent Italian dinner in NYC, look no further than Portofino Grille
Despite the Disney-esque decor, this restaurant has consistently pleased my husband and I with delicious pasta and fast, attentive service
They have an outstanding bread basket complete with two special olive oils and we especially like the four cheese tortellini
This is also a nice choice for bigger parties because of their extensive menu choices
Our family had a lovely Mother's Day dinner at Portofino
Even though the restaurant was crowded we were not squished in
Service and food both delightful
We always take guests to Portofino and go often on our own
They have a good wine selection, consistently good food and the service is great
A delightfully romantic restaurant that makes one feel at home
Ever since the very first time I had lunch at Portofino, that was about 4 years ago, I fell in love with the place
Coming to Portofino is like coming home, friendly staff, good quality kitchen, great bar
The staff is like a family, they know me, I know them
Menu offering is diverse, reasonably priced and well prepared
The servise is probably the most friendly and courteous I have experienced in the city, that is on a consistent basis, mind you, I know what I am talking about because I have been dining at Portifino 1-2 times a month for the past 4 vyears or so
It is a great to have a romantic dinner for 2 by the fireplace or to have a larger gathering for up to 15 people, I have brought a number of parties to Portofino and they have always been a success
We celebrated my December birthday here
The astmosphere made us feel like it was Spring/Summer in Italy
This is a challenge for any restaurant especially in the Winter
It was more than delightful!!
The ambience and beauty of the star-filled skies and varied decorated rooms brings a peace serenity that is much needed in our changing world! Larry is professional, warm, gracious giving personal attention to his customers which is much appreciated
The staff accommodates for special needs or changes on the menu; the food is delicious; the prices are reasonable
It is a quality restaurant! And I love getting a free dinner in my birthday month!
A rare gem on the upper east side
From the friendly greeting upon entering, the attentive bartender and the great wait staff you feel like you've stepped into Italy
The menu is varied and even the pickiest diner can find something to suit their taste that is well prepared and will have your tastebuds working overtime
Don't think I have ever left there without a doggie bag
It is always a lovely evening at the Portofino Grille, the food, and the ambience take us back to romantic evenings in Italy
Staff is consistently very friendly and this even makes the food taste that much better
In addition to fab evening dining, the weekend brunch is wonderful
Great fresh food, entertainment and excellent service
From the lovely Italian decor, to the great Italian food
Eating at Portofino is always a great experience
The Sunday brunches are superb
Go there hungry because the food is always great
Charming authentic Italian decor, ambiance
Large space divided into separate smaller rooms for cozy dining, plus one with woodburning fireplace, perfect for dinner parties
Very good food, accommodating kitchen for special requests, fairly moderate prices for E 60's, attentive service, huge drinks, good wine list
Great hit with out of town guests

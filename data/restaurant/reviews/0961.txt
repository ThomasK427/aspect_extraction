The overall atmosphere was comfortable not at all pretentious
We ordered off the prefix menu I highly recommend the Sour Cream Cloud Cakes with fresh berries
The Dim Sum BBQ Kobe beef were also amazing
We had an assortment of desserts, with perfect portion sizes
The birthday girl's dessert included a candle the staff came by with birthday wishes
The meal was a little pricey, but worth it
Usually brunch spots are loud, crowed rushed
This was very calm serene
I was surprised to see a table with a small child was impressed that an elegant restaurant so easily willingly accommodated a family
I will definitely return highly recommend it for anyone with out of town guests or clients
The view is absolutely amazing and the wine list impressive
But otherwise, Asiate is extremely overrated
The service was terrible-- our lunch group waited 40 minutes past the time of our reservation to be seated-- and the food was bland
Not worth the time or expense
Especially skip if you have less than three hours for lunch
An article about the logistics of restaurant week stated that one of the objectives is to bring people back after the promotion
Asiate is, for me, a success story! Although their prix fix lunch menu only offered one appetizer, one entree and one dessert, all three were outstanding and I can't wait to schedule more lunches just for that menu (which is being offered through Labor Day)
Of course, the view - barring the ugly black monolith that is the Trump Building - is exceptional
We had no problem with the reservations
The hostesses were very nice and the service was fine
The view and food were lovely
We had a very nice evening
I made a reservation for dinner on the night of my girlfriend's birthday
When I called to confirm, the reservationist told me that my reservation had already been confirmed that afternoon, but for a different time than I had scheduled
When I explained that my reservation had been at 7:30, she informed me that they didn't even take reservations between 7 and 8
When I asked to speak to a manager, I was sent to voicemail, and I still haven't received a callback
Asiate looks very beautiful, and the menu is intriguing, but if you have a special occasion, I recommend trying someplace where the staff can handle the reservation process
We're very disappointed
I made reservations for my Husband's 30th birthday
They happily accomidated my request for a window seat - even gave us a private booth table for 4 people - and the restaurant was full
The server gave us an extra appetizer to try - all three were delicious - the Fois Gras was perfect
The view was fantastic, the ambience was romantic - the main courses were delicious, maybe my Guinea Fowl could have had a bit more sauce, but otherwise it was perfect
We had the Crepe (delicious) and the Chocolate Fondant (One cup was warm and delicious, the other was cold and tasted like very strong liquior)
The timing of the food was perfect, the waitress recommended great dishes
Overall, it was a beautiful evening
The restaraunt is HIGHLY overrated !!! Bad food, very pretensious service
They gave as such a hard time to make a reservation
The food is nothing to talk about, for such an expensive restaraunt, they should definitely change their chef, deserts are just funny, I can make the same concoction at home at virtually no cost
Drinks are $17 dollars
Pre-fix evening menu for $69 p/p comes out to $150, they even charge for spring water $10 per bottle
Please avoid this place
Such a shame, nothing impressive
Please AVOID, don't waste time and money
believe me
I should have read all the reviews on Citysearch, thay are honest and helpfull
extremely disappointed cannot begin to describe the expereince
the food was extremely salty, out of six people, no one finished their food
More than half of the dish went back but no one seems to care to ask if the food was okay
View is fantastic but I do not recommend the food there at all
Extremely intersting meal--on a par with the best in New York, or anywhere
Great combination of French-Japanese, somewhat like Tetsuya's in Sydney
Also, Asiate offers the best view in NYC for dinner
We enjoyed both the great meal and the great view--a terrific combination
It's definitely a let-down
My boyfriend and I went for lunch
While the dining room decor is elegant, the view of Central Park is disappointing with the Trump Tower smacking right at the center of the Central Park view
My boyfriend ordered lamb chop
For such a high rated restaurant, food quality was definitely below par of what we had expected
Also, the staff was ill-trained and disorganized
When our entrees came, at least 3 or 4 waiters / waitresses came by at different times to wish us bon apetit
After a round of bread, we already told them not to offer more
But they kept coming back to ask and offer
While it was certainly courteous, the repetition (and annoyance as a result to the diners) was an obvious result of lack of staff organization
An absolutely sublime birthday dinner experience - the space is intimate and elegant, and the famed breathtaking view is exactly that
The menu offers a delectible range of flavors all composed masterfully and the prix fix philosophy means your meal is prepared with precision arrives swiftly
My date and I enjoyed appetizers of shrimp cooked to a delicate perfection and a tuna sashimi delivered in a ginger soy, fresh and very tasty
Our main courses consisted of sea bass, moist and light in a crunchy skin complimented with a deliciously salted soft shell crab; and a wonderfully delicate boullibase of lobster and mussels
A gracefully prepared birthday napoleon completed an exquisit evening
The staff was attentive and delightfully accomodating, allowing us to change our table mid meal to get closer to the windows overlooking Columbus Circle
Perhaps a bit pricey for some, the Asiate experience is well worth the investment
Thought the prix fixe lunch was a excellent
Food was very tasty and portions were big enough that you felt like you'd eaten
The service was very friendly and daytime views were spectacular
I'd like to go back for dinner and also would recommend for business dinners (especially with out of town clients)
Very much the ladies that lunch spot dujour as the room was wall to wall Chanel
The menu is filled with eye-widening surprises
The service is getting better and better every day
You may not like the Prawns like Mrs Hesser but you have to give credit to Chef Nori's details when you look at the Bento Box, you have to be honest and agree that it is one of the best and also most interesting wine list in New York and please don't tell me that the service is not good when you are surrounded by the most attentiv and detail oriented service staff I have ever seen
When I read some of the reviews in this section, I am not sure if they had diner in the same restaurant and also I would not be suprise if they decided to have their Branzino well done with butter on the side
!!!  Just come and be your own critic
Adios,
Bad service from the start
There were bouncers in the lobby of the hotel
When we finally got upstairs (on time for an 8:30 reservation) we were told it would be another 10-20 minutes
which then stretched to an hour as couples who arrived after us were seated first
There wasn't even a decent waiting area--on a Friday night the lounge is full--and when we tried to sit on the only available seating (granite ledge outside of the restaurant) another bouncer w/ an earpiece told us to move
The maitred' did comp us champagne but not before giving us attitude when we first complained about the wait
Yes, the view was beautiful, but the food was ok or slightly above average at best (the desserts were creative)
For a $65 menu, you can have a much more fulfilling dining experience at other places in NYC(any Danny Meyer restaurant, for instance)
Our dining experience could have come from a science fiction story
An array of exotic dinnerware and utensils, ultra modern decor, unusual tastes and stunning presentation in addition to the dazzling view of New York City from the 35th floor of the restaurant ignited all the senses
What some dishes lacked in taste was compensated by a show on a plate
Given time, this new restaurant will fly
Recommendation:  1
replace that weird tasting bread with an assortment of different breads
2
wines that are to be paired with the tasting menu should come with the dish, not after, as happened to us
However, when our waitress realized her faux pas, an extra glass of wine was sent to our table and all was forgiven
Overall, it was very impressive!
The spectacular city views from Asiate, the swanky lounge--and must be seen in bar are MORE then enough reason to pay a visit

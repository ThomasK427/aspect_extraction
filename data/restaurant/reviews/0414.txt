It was great, I hope they add it to the regular menu! My boyfriend really liked his fried chicken, but hated the Philipe Starck looking chairs
thought they were very small and uncomfortable
I think it's true, a large person probably wouldn't even fit into one of these chairs! The bar stools were also pretty silly because they are metal and are very heavy and hard to move
OVerall, I like the place and would go back
yummy food and yummy waiters! i eat here regularly since there aren't many good places in the neighborhood, close to home
i have always been seated promptly, and the service, while a bit slow is nonetheless friendly
the food is quite delish, and i haven't had anything i didn't like
yet
Please tell me how someone can get away with charging 20 dollars a plate for food that is dry and small and service that is slow
?
The service was so slow
It took forever to get my food and when I did get it I couldnt start eating because there wasnt even silverware on my table
It took a good ten minutes to flag down my waitress! Overpriced considering you can get better service and atmosphere anywhere in the city for a much better deal !
Slow service, ok food, way too overpriced! Not the best of Morocco, thats for sure
Thankfully they had belly dancing or I would have walked out
This is a place you go to ENJOY, not gourmet
Slightly pricey (main dishes around $20) and dry, the Moroccan beer, Casa Blanca, is expensive $7 a bottle
So much for the criticism
BUT we were warmly welcomed
The bartender/waiter treated us to free wine, the free entertainment: music and belly dancing were wonderful
The place was beautifully uncrowded
We're coming back again and again
Come for a great time, clap to the belly dancing music, along with the locals, enjoy the atmosphere
You'll forget about the food
--Drink club is a roving group of NYC drinkers
After my friend and I were shunned by The Door, we crossed the street, walked up a block and discovered Tagine
The belly dancing show had just started; my friend and I stood at the door watching in amazement
The owner saw this and invited us in and made sure we were seated right away
The decor was beautiful and intriquite and there were pillows propped up on the opium-bed-like seats
Later that evening the customers actually got up to belly dance, there were live drums and the food and hookah was fantastic
As we were leaving the same man that invited us in made sure he let us know that we were welcome to come again
I highly recommend this place for anything, whether it be a common night on the town or a planned celebration
This Place is truly a find
The tagines are fantastic as is the cous cous and homemade sausage
we just went there tonight and had a blast of a time
it was awesome, from the drinks to the food to the music and belly dancing! the staff was very pleasant
an overall fun and exhilirating experience
If you are looking for a place that has spectacular food and a magical, exotic ambiance, Tagine's is the place for you
When you step off the gritty New York streets and walk into Tagine's, something magical happens: superb Moroccan food, pulsating Middle Eastern music and a warm and attentive staff greet you
We have gone to this restaurant many times and have never been disappointed -- the food is always excellent
We especially liked the Chicken Tagine, a mint-seasoned lamb called Kefta Tagine, and the Bastilla, a pheasant baked in a wrapped pastry, seasoned with almonds, cinnamon and nutmeg
Also try the homemade Moroccan pastries for dessert with mint tea
We also recommend the Moroccan wines -- especially the Amazir, a dry red that was very good
Bring your friends and family, this is a great place for everyone
Excellent all around
The food was bursting with flavor
We ordered the vegetarian tagine and chicken cous cous
The waitstaff was attentive and helpful and they had great live music and belly dancing
The decor is like being transported to North Africa with the wonderful wall tapestries and colored pillows
If you like Morroccan Food
Tagine's is a must
Everything was great; live music (although I liked the Middle-Eastern music on the stereo more), great decoration, comfortable seating, great food, and I hear they have belly dancing and other great stuff going on; its all there
There's even a loungy downstairs
It was hard to pull myself away from the arabian princess pillows and excellent Algerian wine
It's an absolutely wonderful place
I found it relaxing as well
The only negative thing, if any, was that on Valentine's Day they were turning some people away who didn't have reservations (I felt bad that others missed out)
With all the room downstairs, I think they could have easily taken in whoever came by
But I'm glad it wasn't over crowded
I had a very romantic, taste bud stimulating evening
PS - get the front area by the window; it's like lounging in a decadent opium bed
Tagine is one of my hidden jems for NYC
I usually stop by once every two weeks for dinner
Extraordinarily cheap for what they have to offer, where else can you spend $30 and drink excellent Sangria, eat great food, and be entertained by belly dancers stepping to live music
If it is your first time there, I would suggest the following
Below is what I order everytime I go, its my regular menu when the Chef does not take control of what I eat
Appetizer Beverage -- Sangria ($8) Appetizer -- Lamb Borek ($8) Appetizer -- Olive Paste ($3) Meal -- Bastille ($18) {Pheasant in an almond pastry topped with sugar} Meal Beverage -- Casablanca Beer ($4) The only negative attribute of Tangine is its location and exterior appearance
Inside though it great, especially with the belly dancers and hostess' (especially Ixiana)
The hostess and service is excellent
Their seafood dish is good but you have to order this in advance
Their appetizer and dessert has nothing special to offer but their mint tea is different but pretty good
Especially during weekend with live arabic music and belly shows
You can not miss it!
The Scene A neatly pressed, cultured clientele tarries in stylish environs (Moda is Italian for "fashion") at this refreshing eatery in midtown's Flatotel
The Milan-esque decor includes granite aplenty and dark walnut tables with inlaid lighting
Well-drilled, professional service is the norm
The Food The contemporary Italian fare can hardly contain its exuberance
Moda's complimentary hors d'oeuvres tray--lemon-cured olives, white beans, Parmigiano Reggiano chunks, butter whipped with olive oil and addictive bread--is one of the classiest in town
Other standouts: artichokes braised, baked and fried in a salad; a colossal seared Maine lobster engulfed in cherry tomato-tarragon ragu; and the super-generous rack of lamb served on a bed of braised leg mixed with white beans
I went with two friends for Restaurant Week
We were seated immediately and the waiter was very attentive, but to a fault
He asked us which wine we wanted (by the way, an expensive wine list for so-so wine) about four times in ten minutes, despite the fact that we were clearly not ready
When we finally were, he was nowhere to be found
He was friendly, but rushed us throughout the dinner, despite the fact that the restaurant was not full
All of our courses were brought within 30 seconds of each other- awful- the staff had absolutely no sense of timing
The food was good, but nothing extraordinary- just okay, especially for the price (even though we were paying the fixed price)
The decor was nice, but it was very loud with the hotel bar right there
Overall, there are many more- and better- options
Me and a friend came to try Moda out for restaurant week
I wish I had randomly picked another place, we were terribly disappointed
We were seated fastly enough, and ordering was painless, but I got the wrong appetizer, we both received the same item instead
That by itself wasn't so bad, but the food was pretty mediocre, especially considering the prices
My steak was actually not bad, my friend's cod was pretty tasteless
The waiters weren't very attentive, and were a sour bunch, not very professional at serving
The worst part was getting the check
It took around 20 minutes to get the check, after having gone through 3 waiters
They also automatically added the service charge, a bit unusual considering we were only two people
Even with the restaurant week special, I didn't feel it was a good deal, I wouldn't go back
The first time i was at Moda was last February it was great
I was there this Valentine's day it was even better it was extremely buzy, but still made me and my fianc feel great

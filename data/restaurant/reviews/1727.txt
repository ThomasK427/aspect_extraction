And the french fried that accompany the burger are some of the best I have ever tasted in the world
Worth a stop!
In Short Inside Bamiyan, ornate tablecloths, cushions and carpets give a luxurious feel to the otherwise casual windowed dining room
The menu of Afghani favorites includes mantoo, the spicy beef dumplings in yogurt sauce; chicken with walnuts and pomegranate juice; saffron-marinated filet mignon; grilled Cornish game hen; meat and fish kebabs in various combinations; and a number of vegetarian rice- and bean-based dishes
Several refreshing salads are also offered, as well as familiar Middle Eastern desserts
Bamiyan had a nice friendly atmosphere
If you are tall, be sure to sit at a table with chairs -- else you are in trouble
The pumpkin app is very good
The service is friendly
They put beans in almost everything -- even in dishes which they do not have beans
Tried this restaurant for lunch, and the food was awesome! Seating by the window (on the raised floor) is pretty cool
Nice atmosphere
Very flavorful
Chicken curry was tender and a good mix of spices
I'd definitely go back
I loved this restaurant
Never having had Afghan food, I didn't know what to expect
But I read the reviews and heard about the lovely cushioned bench seating, and so I called for a reservation asking for a floor seat! That was fun! The seating was relaxing, spacious, and felt very homey! The food was fantastic, and served very quickly
My boyfriend and I had the traditional afghan dinner for two and it was A LOT of food for like 63 bucks! The wine list is a bit lacking, but we had a nice shiraz which was reasonably priced
The food has a lot of interesting herbs used in it, but I didn't find anything spicy about the food
I felt it was a great experience, and would definitely refer others!
Not sure where these negative reviews are coming from, but as someone who normally would never eat this type of cuisine, I felt I had to share my feelings on what is now one of my favorite restaurants
My wife and I have been eating at Bamiyan for well over four years
The food, as you may have read in other reviews, is nothing short of fabulous
The service is usually fine
Not spectacular, but acceptable
We have never had anyone be rude to us or ignore us, and that includes the first couple of times we visited the restaurant
The maitre'd (who is also the owner) is always friendly and accomodating, and on the rare occasions where the waitresses have messed up an order, they have gone above and beyond to make amends
You are missing out if you don't try this gem of a restaurant
I went with my boyfriend on a Fri
night and we were seated at one of the cushioned floor booths right away
The ambience was relaxing and intereting to look at and the staff was very helpful
I had delicious cornish hen with amazing sweet rice and the coolest chai tea ever - flavored with rose petals and cardomon
The scallion dumplings were awesome, too
Can't wait to go back with more people
It was a nice change from the Indian I normally eat, at the same fair price
I've gone to quite a few afghan restaurants throughout queens and manhattan and I have to say
this has been the worst
I had to ASK for the bread to be brought out
I never had an experience where they charge for the chutney (which wasn't too good) and the yogurt
the waitress was nice
but we hardly saw her
My reccommendation, go to Queens for better food, service, and money well spent
Rating of 9
5? I think not
1
When one purchases a bottle of wine, it's fairly common practice for a server to come by and refill your glass, but not the case here; 2
There was no offer of water or to check how everything was throughout the entire dinner; 3
Although the menu states that bread is offered with each entree, we were told that it's no longer the case
We were only given one small basket with the appetizers, but we ordered 7 entrees
Good food, but not much variety of flavors - i
e the same cucumber garlic sauce comes with the majority of appetizers
Pumpkin appetizer is delicious
Bread is outstanding - it's worth another dollar to get extra
Seems to use a lot of American ingredients
Don't miss the Afghan tea and the coconut coffee
The environment is great with authentic fabrics and sexy decor
A small, cosy place, slightly overcrowded, but oh! What food, what absolutely mouthwatering food! Also, the portion sizes were large, and the service, very friendly and always with a smile - even at 10 at night! The cushions on the floor and the low tables also looked very appealing
Great place to have good food with family and friends
I eat here all the time and always leave pleased
The food is fantastic and the service consistently excellent
Try the appetizer with pumpkin and the cornish game hen dish
A lover of Mid Eastern food, I went to Bamiyan iwht high hopes, but was greatly disappointed
Food portions were small, cold and did not seem fresh
Service was OK, staff seemed overworked/tired, but courteous
Setting was nice, true afghan like atmosphere, with a place to sit on the floor, lay back and enjoy the food, if only the food were of better quality and quantity
this was the best middle eastern food ever
the decor is so simple, beautiful and inviting
sitting on the floor was so comfortable
after all the delicious food we had the most amazing tea with rose petals and steamed milk
we couldnt get up after we ate and the best thing was nobody rushed us to get out
the waitresses were helpful in helping us order since we had no idea what to get
we had an amazing spinach and lamb dish served with a delicious rice and a really good chicken curry which was not like the typical chicken curry
it was very flavorful with lots of spices but it wasnt so hot that we couldnt eat it
it was perfect
the ashak steamed dumpling appatizers were out of this world
gotta go try it
best part was the check! it filled our bellies and didnt empty our wallets!
I have been to Bamiyan a few times and I can say that the food is unbelievable and the service excellent
The servers are very helpful if you are not sure in what to order
The food is very cheap compared to some others good restaurant
If you haven't been to Bamiyan yet, I suggest you to go and prove for yourself this great restaurant
My boyfriend and I had dinner here on Valentine's Day and it's so sad that a place with such great food at a reasonable price has such absolutely horrible service
We were sitting for atleast 15min
until a waitress came to our table- and that was only after we asked the hostess 2 times for service
Then the table next to us complained that their food was cold and a man who seemed to be the manager came out and made a big scene/acting very angry towards the table and their complaint
That is poor customer service
This place has such potential since the food is so good, but they really need to work on their customer service and making sure their staff is more attentive
A girlfriend and I had dinner there and enjoyed the flavours of Middle Eastern food
The service was friendly and timely, the atmosphere fun and inviting (especially sitting on the floor with cushions!) and the food was incredible! It was also a great value for the amount of food that we had
Definitely a place to check out
And to think, we stumbled across it
It was definitely a good find!
The atmosphere fun and inviting, be carfull if you choose to sit on the floor cushions, you may not want to get up
The food is very flavorful!  Favorites are the chicken dishes, try the hen, potatoes turnovers with yogurt sauce, and leave your mouth craving for more
Perfumed flavored rice, well seasoned meat and veggie dishes, fun decor especially the cushion seats make for a cozy place
Favorites are the chicken dishes, the lamb can sometimes be dry, the okra is good the pumpkin turnovers with yogurt sauce, very yummy
As good as the food and decor are, the service tends towards the slow side
It is a great place
You feel like your at home when yur there

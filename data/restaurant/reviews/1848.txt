so cancelled on the spot
aquagrill was recommended by friends
they accomodated us at the last minute, made a vegan dish as a special requirement, and the food service were tremendous
whatever the owners do when they hire staff, they're doing it very well
i'm a big fan
Aquagrill has been my favorite restaurant for 6 years because of its warm, friendly staff, happening and romantic ambiance and most importantly its commitment to impeccable food and wine standards
Tonite I was once again amazed by this restaurant
They have added a fantastic entree, barramundi with oxtail
It may sound incongruous but it is sheer harmony and perfect for the season
They just keep getting better!
What a shame, use to be so well run when the owner was on the floor
They were very quick to say yes to an 8:30 reservation
We arrived and waited, and waited and waited some more along with about twenty other unhappy patrons
The gentleman at the door was extremely unsympathetic! Reservations mean the same as walkins
After waiting for too long we went next door to Fiama and had an amazing professionally handled meal
Keep that in mind while you're standing in Aquagrill's doorway
They blew their second chance
Never again!
I have not been able to find a better place for raw bars in Manhattan than this place unless I look to go to Seattle or Vancouver
Their choice is good
You must try fresh seaurchin
I did not want to tell anyone because the availability is very limited
keep it secret!
Honestly, where else can you find so many choices of fresh oysters in New York City? I've been to only one other place in Seattle that offers that many choice of oysters in one sitting
I've been to Aquagrill many times and everytime is enjoyable
Great food, great staff
We went to aquagrill last night and had truly one of the best dinners ever
I started with the crab cake napolean which was very good but your basic crab
Then the entrees arrivesd-the tuna is to die for!!! It was cooked so perfect it literally melted in my mouth and the peanut sauce was amazing! I have been to many seafood restaurants but have never had a better experience than this one
Do not miss out-go
When I went for my birthday, it had been years since I'd dined at Aquagrill, and I was pleased to find that it's still top-notch
The service was professional and attentive- they even let us move to a cozier table that opened up 20 minutes after we'd been seated
The oyster selection was impressive, and I loved the Maine lobster salad, tuna tartare and boulliabaise
Only four pieces of asparagus for $8 was a little lame, but overall my experience was a home run
aqa grill has the best raw oyster menu in manhattan hands down!
i just went to this place recommended by a friend and it is really great fish selection
We had a really good time and the food was well prepared
It is great place to eat fish, and shellfish
Go there if you are looking for fish and only!!!
You can find better service, food, decor at hundreds of places
I can't begin to understand the high ratings that this place gets
The food was uninspired, the service poor and the cocktails down right terrible
One might go just to have oysters, but with so many other places in the city that do everything right, why bother?
this is one of my favourite places for oysters
we went early at 5
30 to oysters and champagne and was not disappointed
we were disappointed that we couldn't get a table since we didn't have a reservation, especially as the place didn't serve dinner til 6 and it was not crowded for a early saturday night
so we had dinner at the bar with a really nice bartender but did feel rushed by the host - though we spend $300!!!
If you love a variety of fresh raw oysters with a mix of a nice ambience good service, this is the place to come
They have a main cod dish which just melts in your mouth
This was our first experience and from the minute we walked into the door we were looked after by everyone
The hostess made sure we knew where the lounge was since all the seats at the bar were full and had the waiter come over to take our drink order
From that moment we were guided through what was a memorable evening of the best raw bar (we had the Plateau Royale) and service
The staff was prompt and professional
The raw bar was one of the best I have every had; although a little pricey
The ambiance complemented the evening
We will be back and I recommend the experience highly

After a not-so-great start due to an obnoxious host, the remainder of my evening at Aquagrill was fantastic
The appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all very interesting and well balanced
The waitstaff was attentive and helpful
I'll definitely be back
We had a fairly large party (seven), and I must say, this was one of those meals where everything you eat, from the appetizers, to the oysters, to the entrees, to every dessert, was nothing short of spectacular
One in our group was not overly impressed with the salmon dish, but all in all everyone really, really like what they were served
We ordered seven different desserts, and passed them around the table
It was remarkable how different each one was, but all were excellent
Service was also excellent
Good waiter who knew the menu very well, and made great recommendations
Highly recommended
My wife and I loved the Sunday brunch
She enjoyed the peppered tuna carpaccio appetizer (with grilled onions and avocado) and the roasted cod entree (with wilted spinach and artichokes)
I began with an assortment of oysters, followed by a fantastic grilled pampano (with terrific truffle mashed potatoes)
A mango tart and carmelized grapefruit with grapefruit sorbet were 2 wonderful ways to finish a great meal
Service was friendly, prompt, and efficient
Timing between courses was perfect
We'll be returning soon!
Despite the rave reviews from other posters, I was not impressed with the food or the attitude at this SoHo establishment
The prices seemed reasoable enough and while I did enjoy the raw bar, my entree of the highly touted (by the maitre d and the server) swordfish was overcooked and bland
The service was efficient enough but not very friendly or very accomodating
I am sure there are better seafood restaurants in the city - I suggest trying one of them first
The restaurant is VERY noisey
the chairs are uncomfortable, and the wine list is poor
There are not alot of wines by the glass and most bottles average at about $55
why would anyone want outdoor dining at this place? The neighborhood is not clean
The food was although fantastic and seafood fresh
I do not suggest this place for a date or for couples
Just come here for the food, and food only
The place is also pretty small, not suggested for big groups
i also had trouble making reservations
they seem to be very snobbing
they said, only 6:30 or 8:30 reservations
They do not seat at 7 or 7:30
That just seems strange to me
If you are in SoHo, this is a great restaurant for seafood
The service is professional and attentive, and they add nice touches such as a small salmon tartare before the meal, and a cute plate with some little desserts on it for after the meal
The food is also quite good, and the falafel crusted salmon is an excellent choice
I plan to return for another couple of visits this year
My second visit to Aquagrill was every bit as enjoyable as the first
She had the falafel-crusted salmon while I had the mushroom truffle chatham cod
The salmon wasn't really my thing, but the cod was excellent as were our appetizers (florida stone crab claws and lump crab salad)

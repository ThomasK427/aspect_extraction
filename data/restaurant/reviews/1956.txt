If the prices were comparable to Soho Steak then I MAY go back but they aren't
so I would rather go to Angelo and Maxie's and deal with the crowd
Went with friends last night for dinner and really enjoyed our meal
I agree with other reviewer that each person with drop $100/each for app, dinner, a couple drinks
But our service was the biggest deterrant
We ended up having to have the maitre'd bring us water, utensils, the check
Our waitress left much to be desired
some of the most satisfying meals I have eaten in NYC
service is great
food is better
I was completely impressed by every aspect of City Hall from the moment I walked in -- greeted into this oasis of spaciousness and true TriBeCa decor by such a gracious host
Our server was of utmost perfection, attending to every request so diligently and with complete awareness
I've never tastes such delectable oysters; the filet mignon was the most tender meat i've ever had
And to top it off with a guanaja chocolate souflle cake with caramel ice cream--simply delicious!! City Hall is a must for anyone who knows New York cuisine!
Went there on a date recently and had a wonderful experience
I had the peppered tuna steak that was perfectly prepared and delicious
My date loved his prime rib
The decor and overall ambience was delightful
Highly recommended
My wife and I had a wonderfull expierence at City Hall
The Steaks and Lobsters are out of this City
Went with a group of friends and everything from the appetizers, to the main courses to the desserts were very tasty
We'll be back again
My friends and I went here for a birthday party
We all had different dishes and everyone was extremely happy
The ambiance was nice and the service was excellent
In Short A mecca during the hard-partying, decadent '80s, now the familiar burgundy and black banquettes and lazy ceiling fans create a comfortable, stylish neighborhood vibe
The brasserie-style menu remains relatively unchanged, featuring classic bistro choices like frisee salad with bacon, blue cheese and a poached egg, steak tartare, moules and steak frites, and various burgers and sandwiches
A brunch features French toast, eggs Florentine and oatmeal with brown sugar and fruit
From a former employee who has also eaten at the Odeon:  to EAT at the ODEON:  standard stuff done well
Anything from the beef tartare to the steak is terrific
The calamari appetizer is fantastic, as is the goat cheese salad
Eat some of the fish dishes and meat, and indulge yourself in side orders of the fries
PLEASE ASK for extras of the Odeon sauce
It's a great, slightly spicey, totally addictive aoili
And the hanger steak is amazing, it comes with a great bernaise sauce
(did i spell that wrong?)  here's the caution: the tough house manager makes the new waitstaff only wait tables for brunch and lunch until they're lucky enough to work dinners
therefore, you only get decent waitstaff for dinners
the brunch and lunch waitstaff are all newbies and have to figure out whether you want your omelette regular or usual, which entails the condiments on top of the omelette
and now that outdoor seating is a commodity, good luck getting a table outdoors
My experience couldn't be more different from the previous review! Everyone from the hostess to the bartender was extremely nice
The waitstaff was very attentive
Try the spinach salad with goat cheese and pine nuts - well seasoned and the spinach was fresh
I also had a delicious fig tart which was absolutely delicious
In fact, given the large volume of people who walk in and out, I didn't think that either service or food was compromised at all
Highly recommended
What happened to The Odeon? Lately, the odds of getting good service is 50/50
We were there about a month ago and the guy was on top of everything
But last week, another guy, forgot we were there
Still
the food is consistently good
The calamari is excellent, as is the lamb
Another place to eat late at night after a party or a date
the simplicity of this place is its greatest advantage
yikes: this is loserville
it's over
it was a long time ago
To start off your meal, the bread basket filled with yummy cranberry scones, pumpkin bread and corn bread that is worth the trip alone even if you don't order another thing
Wash it down with their rich coffee and order the Eggs Benny- its to die for
Not overly buttery or lemony and they don't over-cook the eggs like some inconsiderate chefs like to maliciously do
The potatoes are seasoned to perfection and shaped into a wedge that is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside
If it's a nice day sit outside- there is alot of foot traffic in front but not alot of cars on the weekend, which makes for a pleasant dining experience
I had lunch there 2 weeks ago with a friend
Since I'm a great fan of all French food, this place didn't disappoint
Food service was delicious attentive repectively
i would HIGHLY recommend this for brunch
Not for the main entree, the staff or the ambience
but for the bread basket
i have never ate something so yummy
This was no poor man's bread
This was heaven
scones as far as the eye could see, the best scones i've ever had! Corn bread that beats cheese cake
and a raison bread like you would not believe
Please go! But leave your low carb diet at home!
They have excellent brunch
If you get there around noon it's not too crowded - after that you might have to wait a few mins
Generous portions and their eggs benedict is always excellent
Good waitstaff
Ooh! La La! My first Dinner experience at The Odeon was simply fabulous! Food was great
Ambience was casual yet stylish, and the service was superb
The wait staff were a sexy group of professional actor types
and don't miss the gorgeous Maitre'D, Sal! This restaurant comes very highly recommended! I loved it!
This restaurant was recommended to us out of towners by some local friends, and we weren't disappointed
Sure, the wait was a bit long for a table, but the service was good and the food was pretty good too
I had the grilled tuna, served medium rare, and it was cooked just right
The vinegarette-marinated onions and garlic it was served with provided an unusual (but very good) change of pace
The calimari was great, too
Dessert portions were a bit skimpy though
We had the flourless chocolate cake with pistacio ice cream - the cake looked about the size of the bottom half of a cupcake, and the ice cream was scooped out with a melon-ball scoop
I don't know what haricot vert might be, but I agree with the last poster
Anything but the spinach
My date and I suspected uneaten portions are secretly being recycled from plate to plate, which is commendable from an environmental point of view but makes for a perilous dining experience
Too bad, because the Roquefort Burger is delicious
Next time, though, I'm sticking with the fries
the food is great, the service is always friendly and attentive, the ambience is classic
overall it is always a great experience except for one small detail
the spinach sucks
it is way overcooked and not flavorful
if spinach comes with your dish - ask to have it replaced with the much better haricot verts
I have been to Zutto several times

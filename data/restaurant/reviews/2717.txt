And wouldn't you know, my partner and I ate the whole thing in one sitting! Not because it was small- far from it- but because it was good pizza, and really hit the spot
Neither the food nor the decor are fancy
Strictly a take-out place; I don't think they even deliver
This is the kind of pizza that you wake up the next morning and look forward to having that last piece for breakfast- my kind of pizza!
the staff is great, but the food is just ok
If you'd like to savor the delicious food of Guayaquil, Ecuador visit Barzola restaurant in Williamsburg, Bklyn
A favorite of local Ecuadorian residents, the dishes are relatively large and will definitely satisfy any appetite
Try the various ceviches (shrimp, conch, crab, etc) and the Caldo de Bola (Plantain Soup)
Stay away from rice dishes but not from the Ecuadorian favorite PILSNER beer
the best meatball sandwich in the city
If you can find a better use for $5 than getting a meatball sandwich from Danny's, you win a cookie
Best pizza in Brooklyn!!! No other can be compared!If you like thin, crispy, great sauce pizza then this is it
Not gooy or anything in that category
Great!
Small place but a great slice of Pizza
Real Italian owners that make pizza the right way
Good value for your dollar
Highly recommended
A+++++++ You heard it here!!!!!!!!!!!
I am a school teacher in the area near Napoli's
They have the best pizza I have ever tasted!!!! Awesome pizza, delivers to my school and gives the school a discount
I can't even write anymore because I am craving it now
GREAT!!!!!
In Short Founded in 1950 in Massachusetts, Dunkin' Donuts has made a name for itself with a menu of breakfast items and sweet treats
In addition to more than 30 varieties of doughnuts and their holes ("Munchkins"), offerings include bagels with gourmet cream cheese and hot breakfast sandwiches, like English muffins with ham, eggs and cheese
The restaurant prides itself on its popular house coffee, too--the same blend that it has brewed since Day One
This donut shoppe is always clean and the service is attentive and friendly
They also have a baskin robbins! 30-something flavors! Truly amazing!
The cook at Cantina can do fabulous things in the kitchen
The Mexican dishes aren't that great but try the Three Cabeneros and you WILL NOT be disappointed
Or, come for a drink and snack on some nachos or a quasadilla at the bar
The atmosphere is extremely friendly and if you are from Bay Ridge
you'll probaby run into someone you know
The Scene Country kitchen decor with checkered tablecloths and dried flowers hanging from the bar hardly screams Bay Ridge
But Circles, in one incarnation or another, has weathered 30 years here
The flagship Circles Cafe on 69th Street and Third Avenue in Brooklyn introduced pita sandwiches to many who had never heard of pita bread
After much success there, several other Circles sprouted up, including Circles International Grill, which offers a more eclectic menu
The Food The Mediterranean influence shows up in the not-so-dainty tuna salad tossed with artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, black olives and capers
The chunky peanut butter curry dipping sauce paired with the Thai chicken sate is almost delectable enough to eat alone
South America, too, is represented with a very basic soft taco--but the international variety may leave diners perplexed
Clear your head with a fresh-baked angelfood cake or Key Lime Pie
Great variety of options, great prices, lots of healthy choices
Cheerful, if harried, service
Great place to order ahead and pick up on the way home from work or running errands
The grilled vegetable platter is sublime, as are the spicy chicken noodles
The Circles group of restaurants scores again with this casual restaurant (incidentally, the first Bay Ridge restaurant I ever ate in)
Quality is top notch and the ratio of portions to the dollar is excellent
I recommend coming here for lunch, although it is a popular dinner spot as well
Hunter Steakhouse is definitely a must-try
Food was excellent - we had the filet mignon (perfectly cooked) and the filet of sole stuffed with crab meat (so delicious)
The prices are affordable and the atmosphere was great for a nice, romantic dinner
My wife took me out to Hunter's for my birthday this year and to tell you the truth, I wasn't expecting much about this place
I WAS WRONG!!! I tried the Porterhouse and was shocked to find that it COULD actually be as good as the Porterhouse at Smith and Wollensky or Peter Luger's! The atmosphere was very relaxed and casual, but the food was excellent
And it didn't have to break the budget
Good food, nice atmosphere, but bad service
makes a good date though
This is a piece of old Bay Ridge from when it was lots of Norwegian, Irish and Swedes
The bread (not Italian) is amazing and the cakes and pies are great too
The hours are limited
They open at 9:00 and don't bother going after mid-afternoon, because they will be wiped out
This place used to be French but you can here them speaking Italian in the kitchen these days
Good Italian bread and pastries
The brick oven pizza is great and the panini are nice too! Nice to sit down or to go
The service is a little slow sometimes, but nothing too bad
I had a very bad service, if you sit outside, no one comes to take order, because they are too busy talking with their regular customers
I find it very rude! The coffee was okay, but it was no different than any other coffee you can get anywhere
Do not waste your money
This is my favorite local coffee house
There are a lot coffees to choose from, and there is a wonderful ambiance
And the staff is always very friendly and accomdating even on a busy saturday night
It's very nice place to stop for a cup of joe after shopping on 86th street
The location is perfect
Their baskets make very nice gifts
The only drawback is that i wish they would expand their dessert menu
We went there with some family friends thinking historic ice cream parlor would be good for kids
What we got was bad food, horrible service, and totally not kid friendly
Seemed like everyone was giving us the cold stare (because we were a chinese and jewish family in conservative bay ridge?)
The food was subpar dinerish - the waitress was incredibly rude and suggested that a 5 yr old girl in our party would have a difficult time finding a husband
And the ice cream, which its so well known for? Mine had icy chunks in it
On top of it, they close really early on the weekend and really wanted us out the door
I highly recommend this place
It's food is amazing and their staff is awesome
I go there almost every saturday
I highly recommend you order cheese fries with gravy LOL A++ very good resturant
This is the best in brooklyn you could hang out at
The bartendars are very friendly and at service with you
The food is great! I always keep coming back here whether for my birthday or just to hang out it awesome! The group ages who hang out varie on different days, but I can't complain it great to hang out there!
I used to love the Dog but now its become a metling pot of really undesirable people
Its become sleezy and you cant go tot he dance area without some middle eastern guy grabbing you
The drinks are still fairly priced and the DJ is good, but overall if you are a bunch of girls looking for a fun night out I wouldnt recommend the Dog
Try Bean Post or Monk instead
If you want to get a lot, and I mean a lot for your money, try The Salty Dog in Bay Ridge
The food is very good, and the bartenders are very cool
salty dog was a great place overall, but my gripe was that there was too many southern brooklyn/staten island goombas all over
as a staten islander, if i truly wanted this crowd, i could have stayed on my side of the verazzano
but otherwise, its a place i would have definetly enjoyed in a less homogenous crowd
i dont think ive actually ever seen such a mass collection of gold chains in my life
salty dog is a great place to get drunk with your friends, but not a place if youre not looking to meet a guido, or a thug
if the guys who own the bar are reading this:  PLEASE, PLEASE add another stall in the womens room
its like tokyo in there

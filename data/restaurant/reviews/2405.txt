Very friendly host and very attentive and patient waiter
(Even though I was only there for dessert) Lovely decor inside
It's cute for a date if you are under 18, but It's not a sophisticated place
It's ok
It's like what you would imagine
It took me 4 times before I was able to get into the restaurant
The other 3 times, it was too long a wait
I travel from Long Island and I wish they would take reservations on the weekend
The frozen hot chocolate is not to be missed!!!!
we waited over 3 hrs for this place and were totally disappointed
we got seated at this tiny corner with x'mas tree poking into our bodies, and then even b4 we were anywhere near finishing the waiter came to take the plates away
after having declined that, he came over not long after and took our plates away despite our protest
that was just plain rude and was obviously trying to make us leave! and the dessert was definitely average
so i say unless u MUST go to this place b/c the movie is ur all time fav, otherwise, save urself the frustration
Our wait was 90 minutes, so we left and came back
When we were seated upstairs, there were at least three empty tables, which I couldn't understand with so many people waiting
We only had desserts, which are nothing special at all, just huge
The ice cream tasted like store bought
My kids loved it, but huge portions of ice cream and hot fudge impress them
I would not go back
The overpriced ice cream is delicious but the service is atrocious - not only do I have to wait to be admitted into this ice cream joint, but the waiter is a snide, gruff man more suited to be a trucker than an ice cream shop server
Only go here if you're already in a good mood
Having tried it twice I have to say Avoid at all cost! Food is below average and service is worse
There are too many great places to go in NYC then Serendipity
Both times have been horrible experiences
My ten year old niece ordered a hamburger and asked that it be prepared well done, but not burnt
My niece is a very polite, quiet, and well mannered little girl
When the meals were served, my niece's hamburger was burnt
My sister initially tried to scrape off the burnt top, but we ended up calling the waiter over asked that she be served another burger since it was burnt
He was very uneasy about this request, but he complied
This woman comes to the table and says, WHO ordered the hamburger? She proceeded to berate my niece and stated, This is the way we cook a well-done hamburger here
She was VILE AND SO RUDE
HORRIBLE EXPEREINCE and I was sorry I brought my out-of-town guests there
Another guest at a nearby table was also appalled by this scene
UNACCEPTABLE
You know what so funny about this terrible dessert place? It's in Manhattan and there are about another 200 in this great city that are so unbelievably better, including Pattsy's which is right across the street
The host was the rudest person I have met in all my life
He was so pretentious and obnoxious
The wait staff as a whole had the mentality that they worked at a truly reputable and important place in Manhattan, when in reality Serendipity couldn't be farther away from a true Manhattan dessert place
It is such a tourist trap
Anyone who is from NYC should know never to go here
My ice cream was melted and the waiter couldn't care less about fixing it
He forgot that he makes minimum wage at a lousy ice cream shop
Whilst on holiday from England I visited this restaurant and was taken aback with how amazing the service was
Our tall good looking Argentinian waiter treated us like Royalty and my first taste of Fffrozen hot chocolate was not a disappointment!! The place was busy with a great atmosphere and yes we did have to wait for a table but then lets face it there is a reason you have to wait
its a wonderful place and everyone wants to go!!(Those who dont like waiting should go somewhere less nice
your choice!)
I always wanted to go to this place after seeing the movie
It was a disappoinment
The service was slow, the food so-so
The frozen hot chocolate was good but pricey
The chocolate shavings on the top were very stale
I would not go a second time
Once was enough
The famous frozen hot chocolate tasted like melted ice cream, that's all
Had an omelette, wasn't bad
Server was a nice guy, no complaints
Decor was kitschy (had the honor or smashing my head on a low hanging Tiffany lamp), but all the kids and tourists were annoying
Definitely hated the vibe
There were children everywhere, the restaurant is terribly crowded with loud, subtly obnoxious people, and finally, not all that cheap considering what you were getting
Serendipity is very much like a diner marked up an extra 100%
The desserts were fabulous! I went there with three friends, and we managed to obliterate two sundaes
My guy friend and I shared the Can't Say No Sundae (a rich concoction of peanutbutter pie, ice cream, hotfudge and whipped cream) and it was fabulous! The other two in our group shared the Strawberry Cheesecake sundae, which was equally satisfying
I can't speak on behalf of Serendipity's real food, as we are all dessert afficiandos, with little desire to waste our appetites on anything remotely healthy
Be sure to go early to put your name on the list- and be prepared to wait an hour or so
Going to this restaurant was #1 on my daughter's list of places she wanted to go in NYC
We went yesterday on 03/16/03
This place has a reputation for their desserts, so we ate a small but overprices lunch to save room for the desserts
The dessert menu was actually very small
There were no mouth watering displays of delicious dessert
For the 4 of us, we had 2 ice cream sundaes and one apple pie
The apple pie was terrible
More like a coffee cake
The ice cream was good, but the fudge sauce did not taste homemade
My sister-in-laws is 100 times better
The restaurant was cramped and the service was slow
We finally went here after hearing about the wonderful desserts
I had the chocolate blackout cake
It was ok I guess
nothing spectacular
She had apple pie ala mode, again, nothing spectacular
Maybe we werent in the mood for dessert or who knows, but it just wasn't all that it was cracked up to be
There is just something about this restaurant I hadn't even seen the movie when I went there! I had the BEST sundae ever- chocolate and peanut butter- it was so good I'm planning my next trip to NYC now!
We had reserved a place 2 months in advance
The host was rude and obnoxious - basically, the worst service that I have ever received in my life
The place was overbooked
The food selection wsa mediocre
Go to Patsy's across the street where the service is cordial and the food is great
Great desserts
Bad service
Our waiter didn't even say a word to us
This is not dick's where you have to be one
great nyc dessert joint, strictly, be prepared to wait about an hour and a half for a table, don't be roped in to buying overpriced tourist trinkets or the mediocre diner food, eat dinner at another place, make a trip here, stick to the abundant spectacular sweets and u won't be dissapointed
The wait was really long, like an hour on a thursday
We had the famous frozen hot chocolate
It was different but nothing worth waiting for
Only good for visiting just for one time! Waiters are always rude, with no MANNERS to customers
Not only poor services, but their tastes are so ordinary
Ican't understand their overprice for every basic manues
Burger is ok, but you will find at least this taste in any other burger places

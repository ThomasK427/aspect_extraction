I simply cannot understand all the bad reviews here on Citysearch
My husband and I have been to just about every top rated sushi place in the city
And this easily ties with Sushi Yasuda for freshness and quality
Sit at the sushi bar and have the sushi chef choose for you
I had fish here that I never would have anywhere else
The service is also amazing
Yes, the ambiance isn't the best but its certainly not hideous! Who cares about ambiance when you have the tastiest sushi ever at your fingertips?
This is the best sushi that I've had in NY, though I've been here a few times and it is somewhat inconsistent
It's always very good, but sometimes it's terrific
Very expensive though
Yes, it is insanely expensive
Let the chef choose and expect to pay $300-$500 per person for a meal
If you are doing a cost/value calculation, you will not enjoy this restaurant
Price aside, it is sushi nonpareil
This is not elaborate sushi (go to gari) or an incredible variety (go to Jewel Bako)
It is simply the best fish expertly prepared by Toshi
Stopped in briefly last night and enjoyed a too short meal with sublime 'neck' toro and yellowtail toro and a handful of other choice selections
The Chef (Toshi) chooses for you, but is not autocratic and follows your tastes
Service is somewhat obseqious/traditional Japanese
Truly serene, casual ambiance
This is the best sushi
I agree with Ogami 100%, and Mr
Grimes berated him for saying the fish is not fresh at Kuruma Zushi
Ogami clearly stated that the fish is fresh
Of course all top sushi restaurants have the same fresh fish, because they all get it from Fultons Market as any avid Sushi fan knows
Mr
Ogami stated that the fish selection at Kuruma Zushi is pathetic which I agree with
In the month of September there are only a few seasonal types of sashimi, those being the best: Silverback Clam, Milk Fish, Swordfish, Arctic Char, and Pacific Sea Urchin
Any Sushi restaurant claming to be top notch, must have the seasonal fish
Kuruma Zushi does not
They always have the same 9 varieties of fish year round, in and out of season
The same as Terriyaki Boy
I agree with other reviewers that the amount of negative reviews and those that say the sushi here is bad, are weird
The toro here is by far the best in NYC, albeit extremely expensive
The limited menu and the price fixes are a pain, but you go to this restaurant for the quality of the fish, not the size of the pieces, exotic menu, service, or decor
Those who complain about the quality and cut of the fish here are clearly not sushi eaters
you obviously know NOTHING about sushi OGAMI san
to say Kuruma's fish isn't fresh is like saying peter luger serves bland beef
Kuruma isn't for everybody since a dinner will cost about $200 per head but it is by far one of the TOP sushi restaurants in the country
and the fact that you name NOBU as a place for good sushi proves your ignorance
nobu you go for the small appetizer dishes
if you want great sushi you go to KURUMA, sushisay, yasuda, etc
Hey, it's the best sushi in town
But also the most expensive
NOt much of a bar to speak of, but if you want the real deal, travel to this tiny, hidden gem in midtown
Take your sugar daddy or expense account with you
Its for the all fur coat but no knickers brigade People who go to these restaurants are looking for nothing but trying to give the illusion that they have money, when really theyre showing they have no class
like wearing a huge, impractical, fake Rolex watch
Enjoying the meal and the service is irrelevant to them Its a 2 star restaurant at 7 star prices
Anybody with a little class would only go to a 5 star restaurant And not concern them selves whether they have 1 or 7 star prices
Great sushi and affordable prices
The japanse go here themselves - thats no surprise
A hidden gem!
I often go to ISE for lunch and I am always very happy with the food
Always fresh, delicious and lunch specials are a great deal
However, the service is inconsistent
I have been several times where it took us 2 hrs for lunch (for 2 people!) but I went just yesterday and we were in and out in 45 mins
Some of the wait staff speaks English, some don't
We also found that getting the check always takes more time
I would recommend going, but make sure to put aside a good 2 hrs for it!
Had dinner at ISE last night
While the food was absolutely delicious the service was horrible
Our waiter barely spoke a lick of English
He messed up my order and still charged me for it
When I say the check took 45 minutes to get after we requested it
I mean 45 minutes
The food is amazing here but it is a shame that the service does match
And you could have it delivered but I don't think sushi travels very well
My husband and I love sushi and always try out different places
This is one of the best, if not the best! Never a bad meal, nor bad service
The food is fantastic, and I really like sushi places with a bar - since I'm not a big beer drinker
Overall, the service is great and I've never had a bad meal there
It's a must try for any New Yorker or visitor
I eat there at least twice a week, and more if I can
This cozy authentic Japanese restaurant is a must for the serious sushi/sashimi eater
It's a wonderful break from those overpriced trendy sushi places where service comes with an attitude
The sushi is always very fresh and the menu is diverse enough for the non fish eater
This place has the absolute freshest sushi
No other compares, really
The salmon is such a beautiful pink you really have to see it
For non-fish eaters the beef negamaki and beef teriyaki are amazing as well!! The staff is really friendly, plus they serve big bottles of asahi
I can't eat here enough
A friend of mine who has lived in the neighborhood for over 8 years swore to me that this place was THE BEST chinese in the city and told me to give it a try if I doubted her opinion
Well, after being a doubter, I am now convinced that S
Dynasty might actually be the best, at least in the neighborhood
The food was hot and delicious
The menu had a ton of variety, but the most impressive part was the affable and friendly service
I would definitely recommend this place!
Our company used to order lunch special from them all the time
We recently discovered that the lunch special went up from $5-$6 to $8-$10!!!! Ridiculous! On top of that they messed up our last food order, and it didn't even taste good! There are PLENTY of other chinese places in the area that are so much better and don't charge so much money for lunch specials that taste like crap
Needless to say our group will never order from them again!
This is a great place to go for Chinese Banquet-- much more upscale than chinatown, cleaner (how can it NOT be?), better service (ditto), with the quality of food expected in a real authentic chinatown restaurant
Call ahead of time b/c they're sometimes booked for big big wedding banquets, thus closing down the restaurant
PS-- get the Peking duck!
My girlfriend and I had visited the Top Of The Tower in mid October '05 for drinks
The view of the East River and 1st Ave were nice but not overly stunning
The location is at 49th St
and 1st Ave on the N
E
corner

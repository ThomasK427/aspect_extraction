SORRY
Brasserie has an attractive decor, efficient service that is not fussy, and AMAZING FOOD! Their steak frites is to die for; the steak itself is great, but it's the frites that I'm going back for! They are crispy, not greasy, and come in very generous portions! My boyfriend, who doesn't share my enthusiasm for red meat, had the Nicoise salad and was happy too
My only complaint would be the bread: the baguette could really be a lot fresher
But then again, who needs bread with those french fries!
Brasserie is one restaurant that I faithfully return to at least once a week; it's convenient to where I live, but it also has darn good food
You can't go wrong with any red meat choices (from a lowly hamburger to an enormous rib eye), but make sure your entree either comes with or is supplemented by an order of those divinely crispy, non-greasy french fries
Absolutely addictive, and worth the extra half-hour on the treadmill
Service is brisk, casual yet professional
The hipsters moved on after the initial 15 minutes, but the setting is still comfortably slick, and you'll still be dining in a packed house any given weekday night--and especially lunchtime
Prices aren't low-end, but appropriate for the quality and portions
Good food in a nice setting
Nothing to get too excited about- it is a mid town expense account restaurant, that you can afford on your own dime if need be
They do great fish from Arctic Char and Halibut specials to menu items like salmon and a mixed seafood grill
Lightingis a little garish in areas
Though the receptionist and seating assistant can be replaced with more service-oriented people, the food, wait staff, and decor were appealing
The grade of ingeredients was noticably superb
I would definitely recommend this place to all the French cuisine fans
The decor of the restaurant is great and the good is delicious
Their yellow gazpacho soup is the best soup I have ever had, bar none!
I have been to Brasserie a few times now, and each time has been memorable
I took my mother there this past weekend for dinner, and while she wasn't ecstatic over her couscous, everything else was wonderful, down to the cappuccinos
I recommend the french onion soup and the lobster dish from the raw bar menu is a must
The maitre d' is TERRIBLE
The decor is great
The barmen are extremely pleasant
The place smells of frying
The restaurant service is lacklustre (OK, patchy - I have had very good to downright awful)
The lighting is either too dark at night or like being interrogated in the day
The food is also patchy
The wine list is decent
For me it is the 'default choice' near the office
Don't come here for 'event' dining
Today in it's smaller, trend setting look, Brasserie no longer serves 24 hour top of the line 5 star Diner meals
Gone is the out of this galaxy French Toast and Eggs Benedict
Thats not to say, the current menu is not good, in fact it's pretty good
The Venison is pretty fair for it's price, the steak is delicious, but the bread could use a lot of work, and the service is lacking
Still it's a fine place
The food here is unbelievably delicious, fresh and the menu quite diverse with a bonus of excellent service
Never dissapointing and the bar/ambiance is also very pleasant
remember to make reservations though!
This place was cool looking! They had a very interesting menu, they liked to throw different spices into regular dishes
I had a pasta dish w/shrimp it was definetly not ordinary, but it was pretty darn good!!! The decor was pretty neat, the bar looked really cool! I'll probably go back just to check out that scene out, which was quite crowded
A hip crowd and an interesting, trendy decor did not bode well for quality dining, but we were pleasantly surprised to receice attentive, thoughtful service and were impressed with our meal
Presentations were unique, but not silly, and the depth of flavor in most dishes was gratifying
Recommend the lobster salad with slaw, and the peach melba with honey-vanilla ice cream!
The best steak frites with emphasis on the FRITES
great wine selection
Must like noisy atmospheres because of the bar scene
Excellent!!
Be careful when you order seafood there
My friends and I all got sick from eating the seafood at the Brasserie
I think we ordered the tuna tartar
I was sick for more than 1 week
The waiter has a nasty attitude too! Conclusion: Don't Go There!
OUR RECENT THANKSGIVING 04' DINNER FOR 10 COSTED $818
00 BUT THE TURKEY AND DRESSING WAS POOR AT BEST
SERVICE WAS GOOD, BUT THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE WAS VERY OVERPRICED FOR SUCH BELOW QUALITY FOOD
BEWARE: THIS WAS HIGHLY OVERPRICED, TOTALLY POOR QUALITY HOLIDAY DINING; FIND OTHER HOLIDAY MEALS AT SEVERAL MIDTOWN RESTAURANTS WHO HAD SPECIALS ON THANKSGIVING DAY, THIS WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT
GIVE IT A 2
0!!!
In Short As busy baristas juggle multiple orders, baby boomers and their adult children line up for a jolt of java in flavors that literally span from A (bold Aged Sumatra) to Z (smooth Zimbabwe)
Those making an afternoon of it at these large-windowed, earth-toned cafes sit in hard-bottomed, ergonomic chairs or, if they're lucky, a cushioned armchair
Snacks range from pastries to pre-wrapped sandwiches
The first store that opened I was there
I had tried Starbucks coffee before it became well known and had thought great
Too bad I didn't think about buying and expanding
So my hats off to the owner, what a fabulous idea
Starbucks to me the only franchise that Always serves a consistent and satisfying cup of coffee regardless of what location you go to
Staff and service does varies from place to place but it's friendly everywhere
Atmosphere is great for anyone to just sit down and read that's why it's opened up in almost every Barnes Noble
Starbucks provide with wide variety of drink for every mood
I like strong coffee but never have got the burnt feeling or coffee grounds at the bottom of the cup
I know that it will never disappoint you
I love this place
The almond croissants are to die for
The coffee's great too, not burnt like Starbucks
Though it is small and slightly overpriced, the taste more than makes up for it
Just try their delicious muffins and madeleines
The service on weekends is always very friendly
But I agree with the last poster, during the week in the afternoons they have that blank stare on their faces
I guess standing all day isn't fun and they're probably underpayed
And sometimes I find the managers are quite rude
I hate to share this little haven
The fact that it is difficult to locate in the midst of busy Broadway makes it a gem - it is sandwich between a dry cleaner and a building
After I discovered this place I will never go to Cosi or Starbucks, it is much more inviting
The pastry is good, I recommend the lemon tart and apple twist
it's cozy and quiet enough to carry a conversation or read a book
The service could use alittle face left
they all seem so depress, I guess being on shift all day is tiresome, which explains why they close so early 7PM for New York : ( I don't even get out to 6PM!
Wonderful little french pastry shop
I love their sandwiches, croissants, and particularly the marble cake
There are a few tables set up on the side where you could sit and have your lunch or dessert there
The shop could be hard to spot, since it's actually off the Broadway
Marble cake is not available everyday
This is a nice, small cafe with solid service
More seating would be great, but the place has a pleasant homey ambience
The baked goods are all pretty good, though the bagels are a touch stale and dry
The only problem is the coffee
It is just awful
It is watery, stale and freeze-dried, which is normal in NY, but they charge 1

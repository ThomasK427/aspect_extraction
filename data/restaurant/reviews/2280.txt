In Short The much-copied look of hardwood floors, decorative stained glass, checked tablecloths, brass rails and walls filled with knickknacks has been a staple at this restaurant franchise
Originally a hit for its frisky bar scene, Friday's is now known just as much for its kid-friendly entrees
The menu alternates between typical American fare (salads, potato skins, Angus burgers and grilled chicken) and modestly international cuisine like fajitas, wraps and pot stickers
This place was horrible
I expected nothing less than a typical fridays and nothing more
What i got was a horrible meal at $20 per burger
I thought the waiter forgot about us but he reassured us that he hadn't forgotten us, just our drinks and forgot to put in our order
I'd rather starve then pay $60 for 2 burnt (asked for medium) hamburders and 2 cokes
SKIP THIS PLACE NO MATTER WHAT
We ate at TGI's on 5th for two reasons
One to experience an American TGI's (having heard they were so much better than the UK ones) and Two because we had such a bad experience on our first night at Mchales
It was a Monday so the place was quiet even so we waited over 5 minutes to be seated
The service got worse through the evening with our main courses arriving before we had finished our starters
The food was distinctly average and the atmosphere dull
The decor was in serious need of an upgrade and the staff needed a serious dose of motivation and enthusiasm (Y'know to be more like the TGI on the ads!) Eat better for less elsewhere
Overall a run down TGIF's esp for a fifth ave location
Went coz I got a mailer about getting Goldpoints the kind that yu get at food emporium
Food was mediocre, upkeep of the place was not there seemed a bit run down, the staff that served us was great and that was the best part of going ther
Paid a bill of $130+ and did not even get the goldpoints
definately do not reccomend this place
In Short Only the name is French at this popular midtown steakhouse
A cavernous art-deco extravaganza, it attracts businessmen using their expense accounts to pay for hefty aged sirloin, prime rib, filet mignon and the like
Most diners choose the prix-fixe wine menu, which includes a choice of appetizer (shrimp bisque, crab cakes, BLT salad, etc
), entree (steaks, chops, seafood), and dessert (apple crumble, creme brulee), as well as unlimited glasses of four wines
I dined here during restaurant week
We were seated promptly, among a very busy lunch crowd
The prix-fixe menu was well worth it, although my frined order from the regular menu (only one course) and paid the same amount
Service was average, but my food was pretty good
His fries were pretty dry, and his meat was very small in portion size
We tried the Wine Dinner last Friday and everything about it was excellent! It's such a great deal - you get any appetizer, main entree and dessert on the menu along with different wines that they keep pouring you when your glasses are empty! The wines were all pretty good too
I had their crabcakes, dry aged rib steak, and profiteroles for dessert - everything was very delicious, especially the steak! The service was great as well and the waiters were very attentive
I will definitely come back here before the wine dinner special ends on Labor Day!
I have not been to cite in about 1 year
My wife and I went and things had changed
The Great wine dinner was still there but the food was much better than I had remembered
We had the chopped salad to start off, it was so good
Then we had the steak and lamb both were phenomenal
we barely could eat the desert
We had one of the best meals and planning to go back again
Go here on a date or with a large group
Eat great food in a really elegant dining room and drink some wine! Then drink some more! By time the entree comes out everyone is relaxed and having a good time
Wine is very drinkable, not the best you've had but it holds it own
Service is great
MY GF TOOK ME HERE FOR MY B-DAY THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS 2005, LOCATED IN ROCK CENTER, NICE SALAD, GREAT HUNK OF FILET MIGNON, AND ENDLESS WINE
THEN YOU CAN GO OUT AND SEE THE TREE STEPS AWAY, SERVICE WAS GREAT, HOWEVER, MY GF'S STEAK WAS NOT COOKED TO ORDER, SHE ORDERED IT W
D
, IT CAME OUT MEDIUM WELL, I GUESS STEAKHOUSES JUST DON'T LIKE BURNING STEAK, OH WELL, DEF WORTH IT, THE WINE DINNER IS THE DEAL TO GO WITH
I have dined at Cite for many years and let me tell you it has been going down hill for the past 7-8 months
The food is way below the standards I would expect at this place, The price is fair for midtown Manhattan but not for the poor service
I have seen many new faces in the staff and must say that is not a good sign for any regular
Come on guys you used to be one of the greats, but now I would much rather get a hot dog from the corner cart instead of dining at Cite!!!!
One word - AMAZING! Went there about a week ago as my girlfriend discovered the 3 course meal with unlimited wine special
We love wine and once I heard it was owned / managed by the Smith and Wollensky Group, I was sold
Service is top notch, you got about 3 different people waiting on you at all times
The unlimited wine
yeah it's unlimited! I truthfully had at least 6- 7 glasses total (they provide two reds, one white, and one champagne over and over and over again!) The cool thing about the 3 course price fix is that there is no special or limited menu, you can order ANY app, ANY entree and ANY Dessert
Yeah it is a little expensive at 69
00 pp but it's worth it
If you drink you'd spend 40 pp on them alone! Male 25, from queens
Cite is great place to eat
It is an excellent choice for a large group or small
You can't go wrong with the wine diner- A great find in NYC
We were a group of 16 from Boston for my husbands 40th b'day party
The ambiance, the service and the food was wonderful
The wine and champagne was always flowing
The staff was very attentive
The steak tartare and the calamari were very good
The filet mignon was done just right
Even though our group got loud the management was very understanding
The sides should have been served in a platter rather than the jar like container
but that was a very minor thing
Our guests had a blast and raved about the restaurant all weekend
Thanks Michael and the rest of the gang
I've been here several times and it's always been good
I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the filet mignon that I had ordered
Although, they charged us $8 extra for french fries to go with the steak and they came in a small cup
The appetizer crab cakes were excellent yummy and so was the red velvet cake
The wine and champagne selection were superb! Needless to say we left the restaurant with full belly's and a little tipsy
Cite was the best! My daughter and I were there for the weekend and this was our first night in NY
We didn't know it then, but it turned out it was our best
The food was excellent and only surpassed by the service
The after 8 p
m
prix fixe included all the wine which each selection complemented each course
Vincent, Chuck and George, among others were excellent and even were happy to take pictures of us celebrating our weekend
It is a must for anyone who enjoys excellent food and superb service
It will be our first stop when we return to NY! Thank you, Cite!
I went with 7 girls to try out their $69 seasonal wine dinner that begins at 8pm during the week
You can choose an appetizer, entree and dessert from the entire menu
On top of that you get unlimitted amounts of a champagne, white and two reds - chosen by the chef
Our waiter wasn't the friendliest but we did get a bit louder the more wine we drank
Everything we had and tasted was fabulous and I will definitely go back for more! A few of us had the rack of lamb and were not disappointed
the seafood was fresh and yummy!  For seven people, the bill came to about $550 without gratuity
like I said, It's pricey
This was the first occasion in which we chose to go to this restaurant for a birthday celebration
The ambience was great, very relaxing
Our waiter was very pleasent and was great at offering suggestions
He's suggestions were the best pick in my opinion
The food was fantastic! And of course the little bonus of wine and champagne didn't hurt
=D I would recommend this place for a girl's night out or just a nice dinner for two

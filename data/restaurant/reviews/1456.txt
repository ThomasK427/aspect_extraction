Definitely worth a visit, just know the shortcomings
The food at Urena was wonderful! For appetizers, we tried the foie gras, the rabbit and the sweetbreads
All amazing! I especially loved the foie gras paste with the balsamic vinegar -- delish!  The tuna entree was excellent
It was served as tuna medallions crusted with seasame seeds and served with a chickpea puree -- absolutely fantastic
My fiance ordered the short ribs, which were great, but we couldn't taste as much as the truffle oil as we would have liked
We got the doughnuts for dessert, but they were disappointing -- the espresso gelee really overpowered everything else on the plate
However, the frosting ice cream (made in-house) was wonderful
My only real complaint is that the lighting was just terrible
It really was way too bright and did not lend for a romantic atomsphere
Also, the wine list could definitely be improved to add some more high-end wines
With A+ food, a lovely staff and an open floor plan; it just seems silly not to put as much care into dcor, as you would each of your elegant plates
Mr
Urena should take the advice of others and update the look and definitely install dimmers
Nothing is this world is perfect, but Urena is on the brink of something really special in a fiercely competitive city
All diamonds need to be polished every once in awhile and I hope this gem will remain in the neighborhood for many years to come
Suggested plates: Poached shrimp, Scallops, Short ribs and Gingerbread cake
Chef Alex Urena is one those talented people that what ever they do, they do it better than most
If you have been following his impressive resume, you'll see the names of some of New York's best restaurants
Also having pastry chef Caryn Stabinsky formerly from WD-50 having on board definitely helps with the dessert fanatics like myself
You need the try the Breakfast dessert, it was the most interesting and exciting dessert I had for a long while
It does sound weird but let your taste buds be the judge
Menu is made of modern Spanish food, inventive and interesting is how to explain it
Ambience is simple, bright and tight
Request not to sit on table 41 which is the table right next to the kitchen entrance unless you don't mind getting bumbed in to everytime a server passes by
I was impressed overall with Urea
The service was slightly over-enthusiastic, clearly theyre still trying to find their groove
The lighting was too bright
The foie gras starter was light and tasty, the flavor progression as described by the chef was amazing
The Serrano ham with prawns was cold terrine style, but the flavors meshed well
For mains, the lobster with rhubarb was superb, the most surprising successful combination Ive experienced lately
The mahi-mahi came with fish eggs on shaved zucchini mushrooms, and while not perfect (a little bland) I appreciated the experimentation
The desayuno dessert was disappointing, it took until the last few mouthfuls to determine how to order each bite to get the tastes to work just dont eat each piece separately
The espresso cost $5 and was horrible!! The wine was delicious, the list was a good size, and the sommelier very knowledgeable
i can't get reservations at el bulli but this guy worked there and manages to create innovative dishes that are also delicious (and beautifully presented)
the rabbit confit app was outstanding as were the scallops - and my wife had chicharon encrusted halibut in a chorizo and meyer lemon sauce which was awesome
i had the chicken which was tender and crazy flavorful
the cafe and donuts dessert was outstanding
the prices were totally affordable - i think the most expensive glass of red wine was $9
the service was very good too - the ambiance was a little dull though and the lights were set too bright
definitely check this place out
We ate here the day after they got their power back from the July 06 brown outs in Astroria, so they had a limited Brown Out menu, and it was really, really delicious
I can't wait to go back and try their proper menu
The staff is very nice, and the portions are just right
I had the steak, perfect, my wife had the chicken masala which was special that night, but should be put on their full menu
Highly recommended, worth the trip
Prices are fair
This place loves food and it shows! I have been here about 8 times and every time it is delicous! The food is excellent, the staff is great, the wine is reasonably priced and the decor is inviting
You can't beat the steak and the specials are always tasty
You cannot lose!
Stumbled upon this place completely by accident,glad that I did
This place is exactly what Astoria has needed for the longest time
Great variety on menu,I've been there 5 times in past 2 months and have been pleasantly surprised each time as food quality is superb and value excellent
Big Portions,some of the best soups I've had in NYC,and desserts to die for
I highly recommend you make the trip to one of Astoria's great hidden treasures,and I'm sure you won't regret it when you're done
watch out for the small animals near the bar the other night went with a few friend and no good service and poor drinks
My Girlfriend I just discover this great spot
We love margaritas
bougambilia has the best, my girlfriend loved, Besame Mucho-spanish for kiss me mucho large selection of appetizers
We visited at 3am and had full dinnner
My friends and I found this place after a movie at the Angelika the other night and thought it looked cool, so we went in
The decor was so unique, it was like a movie set or something
The food was great
The drinks were great, albeit pricey
BUT the service was about the worst I've had in NYC
The girl who served us was CRAZY
She was incredibly RUDE, unwelcoming, and she acted like we were inconveniencing her by being there!! We spent a lot of money in there too - so we couldn't figure out what the hell her problem was
We literally thought she must have been high or something
I've read the other reviews on here and they all say the same thing - everything about the place is great except the service
If they would just get rid of this WACKO chick that everybody seems to be complaining about, they would get more repeat business
I can tell you that until that happens, we won't be back - and that's too bad, because it's a place I'd like to frequent
Casablanca Tearoom is a gorgeous space
We stopped in after watching a movie at the Angelika for a light dinner, and immediately were made to feel welcome
Our sprightly waitress was a delight: charming, attentive, full of information, but never disrupting or intrusive
I can hardly believe any of the negative review writers went to the same restaurant
Our food was served very quickly, and all the different menus (drinks, food, wine, desserts, teas) were provided as soon as they were needed
The tapas combination platter was delicious, in particular the eggplant and the beets, and the warm bread and hummus rounded out the perfect late night meal
The creme brulee was unusually delicate, and garnished with a flower, blueberries and crispy coffee beans for a nice flavour contrast
All in all, a very pleasant experience
WE WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK
I really don't know what was going on, it was a weired surprise
we have been waiting for the waitress that was dancing at the store next door, she kept screaming saying that she was stressed and she couldn't handle it anymore, i was hoping that she doesn't work there, Actually she was our server
the reason we came to Casablanca (which was recommended by a friend of mine) to have fun, and enjoy our dinner, the food was GREAT, but the service was AWFUL
I asked for the Manager she said that SHE IS the manager, but when i told her, that the manager (a guy that was very friendly) took my reservation, she said that he thinks he is
I want this message to be read by the real manager and the owner,  you have a psycho server
its not funny
and we will never be back
I hosted my graduation dinner here on the same night (18 May 2006) as the poster below, but had the opposite experience
The night was special thanks to an abundance of amazing food and wine
Food just kept being served and my guests also took left overs
The tapas, Moroccan mint tea and baklava were amazing
Casablanca Tea Room was the perfect setting for a special occasion, with great service- the owner came over and congratulated me, the food came out in a timely manner, and our wine glasses were never empty
It was all our of first time dining here and everyone was excited to know they had brunch and to come back again to try other things on the menu
It really was a great experience and the ideal setting to relax with friends and escape the loud and busy other restaurants downtown
If you don't mind having your guests insulted and yelled at, have your party here! Even though I reserved a table a week in advance and earlish in the evening, the waitstaff was not only just rude and didn't provide good service, but actually yelled at my guests that she wouldn't be able to get them anything more if they didn't order now because a private party was starting soon and she'd have to take care of them exclusively
I was too stunned and appaled at the time to say anything but that review below about the poor service is totally on target! I don't even think those at the private party could have gotten good service
I recently threw a Surprise Party for my boyfriend here, and everything was perfect
Khalid, the Chef/Event Planner helped me put together a great party with a price fix that could not be beat anywhere else in the city, $60 all you can eat and drink! The decor of the restaurant helped set the mood for a great night
From the Moroccan inspired white furnishings, to the old movies playing on the wall above us, there is no doubt that everyone had a wonderful time
The food was also amazing, and the staff was right on top of things bring us fresh drinks and food constantly
Many of my friends said they would be going back to Casablanca very soon! I highly recommend Casablanca Tea Room, whether for dinning or just for some tea and Baklava

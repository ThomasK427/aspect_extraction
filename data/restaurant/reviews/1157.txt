I already have plans to go back
I went to Mercadito with the girlfriend for a delicious Mexican Feast
We ordered two margaritas to start things off, and the one named La Playa was actually gross, it was overly spicy, dispite positive reviews
The food was good, the guacamole was delicious, as was the pork tacos, but the fish tacos and cerviche was simply OK
I am not sure if I just wanted more mexican-american rather than what thye consider authenic mexican so I might give it another shot
My boyfriend and I were absolutely amazed by this wonderful new restaurant
We had great margaritas, and a set of 3different guacamoles
The guac was SOOOO WONDERFUL, each of the 3 types had amazing flavor - absolute perfection
We also had steak tacos which were tender and delicious, and a side of rice and beans which was amazing
We were served by 1 owner, Darin Rubell who was so friendly and attentive
The 2nd owner, Chef Patricio Sandoval, personally came up to us, introduced himself and checked on how our food was
My boyfriend and I made sure to tell them that their restaurant is one of a kind, and that everything from start to finish was wonderfully delicious
Mercadito is a cut above your typical mexican restaurant and it shows! I know my boyfriend and I will be back for many more incredible meals!! Complements to all at Mercadito
Absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend this nice little 'hole in the wall
' With their future expansion in mind, this 'little market' will certainly become a great attraction
If you haven't been here, go! The co-owners, Darin and Patricio, were perfect gentlemen and very active; they met with us after our dinner to ensure our satisfaction
Top-rated Mexican-South American food has just found its newest star!
Intimate would be a nice way to put a little on the cramped side, though it didn't hinder my eating experience at all
The mango guacamole was out of this world, and the scallop ceviche has such a unique flavor that I literally can't get it out of my head and am already planning when I can get back to eat some
For some reason I was expecting your average Mexican eaterie
At first I was intimidated by the whole sharing concept, but overall I can't wait to go back
I enjoyed the authentic mexican flavours and the cute little Ave
B environment
Prices are fair
Tacos are supurb
Margaritas are falvourful and fairly priced
Do not go if you are more then 2 people - Summer time should bring additional seating in the garden
small place though, actually had the take out (which was very well prepared, packeaged nicely keeping the flaovrs apart and nothing was soggy) the first two times I tried to get a table, but finally sat there on Tuesday
We had a great dinner, reasonably priced, and the Fried Plantains were the perfect ending for a great meal
can't wait for the back to be open and expand the seating
Top 3 things I look for in a restaurant: great food, fun atmosphere, and affordable prices
this restaurant accomplishes all of those things! The food is so fresh, creative, and delicious! The drinks are great, music is great, and it's totally affordable
I like it also how the staff walks you through the menu and makes suggestions
You can share everything, and you walk out feeling like you just tasted a million flavors in one meal
I've already been back a few times!
My dining experience at Mercadito was great! Service, delish food and the tab were all to my expectations!  It's a place that everyone will enjoy!
The chef is incredible, the drinks are great and the staff couldnt be nicer
Very intimate setting and great decor!
While no longer Pantry (they have kept the coffee lady for breakfast), this restuarant has an amazing romantic ambience with a very warm and inviting feel
The entire interior is authenthic and hand-made wood from Mexico and the food is amazing
Better guacamole than Dos Caminos and the taco de camarones had the best sauce i've ever had with shrimp
Killer-good margheritas
I live in the neighborhood and have been waiting for a new top restaurant
The day has finally come! I can't wait to go back
A new back area is being added-on and should be done by December
I work in the area and this is definitely one of my favorite spots in the city because of how versatile it is
I've been there for office parties, watched games, been to brunch and had dinner and drinks numerous times without being dissapointed
The food is great, especially during brunch, and the staff is always friendly and fun
It's a good date spot with the variety of wines and cheese (wine specials on Tuesday's) and watching games on the projecter screen while crushing cheap PBR's makes it a good time hanging out with buddies
It's also got reasonable prices
my girlfriend and i had been shopping in the Soho, Nolita area all afternoon and found ourselves trying to duck out of the heat and the crowds
we were so happy to stumble on this breezy 2nd floor restaurant and rest our weary selves
we had white wine and shared a cheese plate
perfect! we'll certainly be back next time we need a break in the neighborhood
I'm from out of town, but every trip to NYC includes a visit to the Nolita House
It is my favorite local restuarant in NYC with great food and friendly courteous professional staff
Specials change daily, but I have never found one that I didn't like
This place has a lil' bit of everything: good food, drinks, music sports
It even has a chalk wall to write on! Every dish is yummy, but almost too much food
Staff is super friendly
Was in town for work and a co-worker brought me here
I'm glad she did! We sat at the bar first and enjoyed the Knitting Factory martinis while talking to the very friendly bartender and others at the bar
We moved into the dining room for dinner and had a great meal! Service was friendly and attentive
Prices were great too! Was very suprised with the cheese plate
It seems a little out of place judging from the rest of the menu, but it was very good
Great selection of interesting cheeses
Thin crust pizza is good too
And the best part
the Red Sox beat the Mets! I'll be back for sure!
Nolita House has become our go-to in the neihgborhood
The food is excellant and it's actually affordable
My favoites are the the burger and the Risotto w/Chicken
Great wine list too
Service is decent, and everyone is nice
I'd did get a little loud the last time we were there, but I guess that's to be expected on a Friday night
Nice place
Met a friend here for lunch and while the food was excellent (I ordered the turkey sandwich with avocado and bacon), the service was rather unattentive -- though well meaning
It took 40 minutes for our food to come after ordering and only after I asked how much longer it was going to be
My dining companion also ordered a sandwich, so there was no excuse for this level of a wait -- especially on a work day when other people need to get back to the office
I might give this place another chance, but not when I've got somewhere to be
Went here for brunch twice and both times I was amazed by the food
The service is a little slow, it seemed they only have one waiter for the entire restaurant
Brunch is always crowded, but never a long wait
My only complaint is that the live bluegrass music is a little loud, especially if they sit you right next to the band!
Some guy handed me a flyer and I decided to try it out
The food and service were above expectations
The macaroni cheese was great and my friend said the garlic burger rivaled corner bistro Will definitely be back for brunch sometime
friends had told me about this place for a while and have been mening to go
glad i did
espeically on a cold winter night
Loved the overall experience
friendly sserivce with helpful staff
The food was exactly what we needed to warm us up
great chili and mac/cheese
which was perfect and delicious
The burger and spaghetti with meatballs were awesome too
Good prices and nice friendly staff
I would definitely go back
Was expecting greatness after all the glowing reviews but now suspect their odd unanimity reflects something other than spontaneous rapture (if you catch my drift)
This place is nothing special (9

Both of us ordered fish entrees and finished every bite
I would recommend dishes but I bet that everything on the menu is great
Definitely check out this restaurant and don't forget to bring your own wine while it is still BYO
Really an outstanding restaurant
Service was very good
from the door to the waitstaff
just very friendly and polished service
Food was spectacular
flatbreads (steak tartare) were great
salads very nice
entrees (lamb) outstanding
I would highly recommend this restaurant
For now its BYOB until they can get their liquor license
This restaurant is a breathe of fresh air! The flatbreds are to die for, everything that I had was phenomenal
The cavatelli with avocado was one of the best things I have had in quite sometime
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys fine Italian dining with a twist
I am a big fan of Chef/Owner John LaFemina
We always enjoy dining at his other two restaurants Peasant and aPizz
The design of the Orchard is masterly done to create a warm and inviting ambience
Lighting is dimmed and soft but not dark
Tables are spaced nicely to give you room to have a private conversation
Servers are helpful without disturbing
Flatbreads are a must to start with
We tried the Steak Tartar with Parmigiano Romano and it was delicious
As appetizers we enjoyed the Drunken Goat Cheese Salad and Lobster Empanadas
We were amazed by the tasty Lamb Tenderloin and Rib Eye Steak for main course
Food certainly has a Mediterranean influence
Overall The Orchard is our new favorite restaurant in the Lower East Side and it looks like it will stay our favorite for a long while
For now BYO wine until they receive their Liquor License
I went here recently, cute place
Good food and great wine
ive only been once, but the cupcake I had here was more moist and fresh than they have at Magnolia
and no line! I would definitely return!
Selection is not imaginative
Pricey for the size
The chocolate cupcake was very dry
The red velvet was less dry but needed a cream cheese frosting instead of buttercream
I saw this shop in passing and was impressed with the look of the shop and the desserts
I was unimpressed with the taste of the food though
I had the carrot cake which was not all that flavorful
I took 3 cupcakes to go
The red velvet cupcake was so dry I took one bite and pitched it
The german cupcake was much to sweet and dry as well
I hope that the chocolate/chocolate frosting that I am saving for later is better than the 3 above!
I tried this place twice
The first time my sister picked up an assortment of cupcakes
Most of them were dry and the icing too sweet
The second time, a few weeks later, I was walking by and drawn in by how cute the place is
Tried a red velvet cake this time
Five bucks down the drain
It was also too dry and the icing was fine if you like pure sugar
I literally tossed the rest of the piece
A very welcome addition to an area thick with Thai competitors that don't quite compare
Been enjoying it with increasing frequency since it arrived this past winter
The space was formerly occupied by Three Bow Thais--a place that sat comically empty nearly every Saturday night
All dishes I've tried have been memorably delectable
The basic pad thai is deliciously tangy (note: the eat-in version is slightly better than take out)
Chicken pad cashew nut packs a flavorful p-unch
My BF has raved about the cumin chicken and duck basil
We also dig basic standbys like massaman curry and pad basil which are equally terrific
The curry puff and roti pancake appetizers come recommended, too
Much to my delight, I haven't tried a *single* thing yet that I would describe as mediocre
The dining room's decor is contemporary, clean, and simple
You can pop in with sneakers and not feel scroungy; it's also classy and cute enough to take your parents to for a casual meal, etc
The service is always fast and courteous
To boot, take out is lighting fast
I am a 10 minute walk away and all orders are in my stomach (to some degree) in less than 20 minutes
The concentration of Thai restaurants in the Cobble Hill/Carroll Gardens vicinity is high (at least seven come to mind)
If you're interested in taste, this is by far the leader of the packt
Go
Soon
I love this place
This place ROCKS! I went with my bf last weekend
The ambience is nice
simple decor but good lighting and CLEAN
We ordered the appetizer sampler and it has 2-4 pieces of 5 different appetizers for $8! Everything was good and there was so much we didnt even finish
The fish entree my bf got and the eggplant tofu in chili sauce I got were both superb! We are huge thai food fans and this was the best we've had! Have to try the banana tod for dessert
we were stuffed! def going back
EM is great! I totally recommend it EM has great food and great service
The prices are extremely reasonable
I usually get the lunch special take out order which is a total steal
For 6 bucks you get soooo much food
Worth trying! And once you try it
you'll be a fan of EM just like me! The atmosphere is lovely as well if you want to dine in
Beautiful decor
I was sad to see Blue Star leave, but I tried South on the recommendation of a friend
He suggested the blacked catfish (house specialty) and it was very good
I loved the memphis pulled pork
There are plenty of other tasty sounding items on the menu that I will go back to try
Maybe I'm just bitter because South took over the space of my former favorite neighborhod restaurant (Blue Star), but this was a very disappointing meal
The food wasn't bad, just boring
The menu is a cookie-cutter clone of every other bland Cajun restaurant you've ever eaten in
Nothing special here at all
(And the mixed steamed seafood appetizer took *forever* to arrive -- apparently the oysters here are shucked by machine, and they only have one shucker, so if more than one table orders anything off of that section of the menu, you'll be waiting a while
)
ive been to the midtown branch of this restaurant, and had a good experience with their burgers
ive passed by this new one before, and finally decided to try it out last night
theres a lot of seating available outside, and its really relaxing to watch people walk their small dogs (or equally small children) by the river at sunset
our waitress was friendly and efficient
we started with the oyster sampler ($24)

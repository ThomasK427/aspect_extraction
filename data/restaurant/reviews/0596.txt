there is not one thing i could say bad about this place ,,at worst the place is a little hard to get to if you live on the fabulous upper westside, but it was def
worth the trip
The pizza with buffalo mozz
and fresh tomatoes are so fresh and simple tasting, you could make a meal of it , but dont cause the wild boar lasagna is outstanding, and my wife loved her oven baked whole fish, the size of this oven is incredible, and they only burn wood, so simple yet so good
If you are expecting the average run of the restaurant type of food then Apizz is not your kind of place
The pizza is made of the freshest ingredients and the wine list leaves you with some of Italy's finest offerings
The wild boar lasagna, which was recommended by our server, was fantastic
Thank you for an enjoyable experience
loved the pizza , up there with some of our favorites, gets high marks for originality, buffalo mozz
square shape, and nice oven, gnocchi dish with sunday sauce was nice, and the gelatos for desert are worth going back for, a little loud ,,but still intamit, not cheap, but i guess you get what you pay for,
go here first, its the only real good food with out paying ridiculous prices on the lower east side, the portions are huge, we get a salad and a pizza and then the movie its nice,,, mabey they will offer a dscount to movie go'ers like us we are loyal
when we read about this place it seemed like a new pizza joint , worth checking out to compare to our favorites, what we found was a really cool restaurant with better then average food and ok pizza, they use buffalo mozz
i think it is to tangy for pizza, so people love it, like my dinner companion, but what we both agreed on was the amazing pork chops and skirt steak that came out of this huge wood oven, we went for pizza but will go back for more
its the second time here for me, i needed the phone # so i looked it up on city search, and now i know why people take time to write these reviews, if you truley like a place you want to tell people and do the restaurant a favor for the great time and great food they provided to you, this place has been wonderfull from the food to the private club feel it gives you, you feel like everyone there most know someone you know because how else would they know about it, it just relaxes you to get into your company and good conversation, they dont rush you and they dont forget you, its perfectly normal sevice with a smile, hard to get in this city
After getting a recommendation from a friend, i checked out this cute LES establishment last night
Only being a block or two from my house will make this great place a new favoriate of mine
The atmosphere is warm, intimate, but fun, too
The complimentary bread comes with this great cheese and tomatoe sauce, ymmm! I shared one of the pizzas and eggplant appatizer and we had plenty for the both us to take home
i wish i had room for the wonderful looking desserts
Next time for sure!
just perfect, i thought a small place like this was not going to be good for a party of 20, but it turned out perfect, the service was on, the food was great and the mid-course of pizzas they did for us was great , i recomend it
after freinds from midtown told us about this place we had to figure out where eldridge st
was first before we could go
We live in flatiron forever and we never heard of eldridge st
, little be knowns to us this restaurant and neighborhood is very popular, its really a nice part of town to vist, its where all the imigrants came to settle, and this place just came out of no where in a brick very unassuming building with delicious italian food for real people, the skate fish was wonderfull as was the skirt steak, we split a pizza magherita to start which was yummy, we cant wait to go back
good thing the food is great the place has such a nice feel because no one i was with could find it, and we all live in the city, but after we settled in it just got better, private cozy, and nice people,
i never wrote about a restaurant before but this is terretoriand , i live on this block and was coming into this place since it opened, the chef/owner John made sure we always got taken care of no matter what, we loved this place, and on sat
night it was so crowded we couldnt belive it, we know the food is great but for people to travel from the upper eastside is crazy, find your own place near you, thank god they still remember us, and know their loyal customers, it goes along way, long enough for me to write this and i hate to write
thanks
i cant belive how perfect this place was for an early dinner , which included a nice artichoke salad, a great pizza gourmet style, and we split the whole fish, then walked down the block to the new sunshine movie theater, its just that much nicer then most of the usual local joints, it feels like your out on the town and not even going that far
This place has the kind of food that you giggle after biting into it
it's that good
My boyfriend had the pork chop with vinegar cherry peppers (he's on Atkins), which was so good
The peppers have a really flavorful kick that balances the pork
I loved the ravioli with morels
it's rich and cheesy with an earthy flavor in each bite
There were also a ton of really good and affordable wines by the glass
This place is definitely a treat!
did not expect this just walking up the block from the movie theater, the food was delightful, cant wait to return for the pizza as well as other dishes
going on a recomendation of a foodie friend we checked out apizz, definetly an unusual place for a restaurant but worth trying to find it, the whole stripped bass was the winner, then the veal chop comes in second, and skip the pizza its not worth filling up on, desserts are a must especially panna cotta
a user freindly wine list
these pork chops with a vinegar pepper side are insane, they are like carmelized in their oven and are crispy and juicy
the pizza is good but thats all
i love this pizza, its not greasy or filled with mounds of cheese, its just fresh tomatoes basil and buffalo mozz
baked in a real wood oven, its to die for
i never talk or write about anything especially food unless its amazing
these guys are doing something right , not only is apizz a great place its their 2nd place and its smaller, usually the 2nd place is bigger and people forget their roots, well these guys have gone back to basics cooking out of one wood burning oven , and producing some good stuff
i think they really enjoy making people happy
mmmm
most of the food is ok, if you like heavy italian dishes but the one that stands out is the pizza, its really good,,
my wife took me here with about 10 friends ,everyone thought the food was great and it is so intimate it made the whole night great
so nice inside , we really enjoyed the escape from the city in here
The wine list was superb, the steak is great the fish also, the ravioli was vey cheesey
this place is so much fun , first when you walk in its like a secret speak easy or something, then the vibe from everyone there is so uplifting, i loved it, and oh yes the food is amazing
in a city that sometimes tries to hard at being hip, a place like this stands out and shines
We had an amazing dinner with 6 people who all loved it
Everyone felt like i did, good food, good people, and they appriciate having you there
They actually sent over dessert on them , just because they reconized my friend who has been there 2 times before, never does that happen in this city, never
What a quaint little place burried down on the lower east side, never expected such good food or wine down there
Definetly a terrific spot for a special anniversary like we did, and my partner was so impressed by the romantic feel it has
The only problem is parking, there is none
everybodys a critic, except this place dosent care, they do the real home cooked food in a huge oven right in front of you and they do it well
They dont try to fancy up their dishes with ingredients i never heard of , foods great and people super nice
I have lived down on the lower eastside my whole life, i have seen the trendy places come and go, this place is one not going anywhere
The owner is making sure of it, talk to him for a few minutes and you can see the pasion he has for his food and more important the respect of a customer, the food blew me away and i cant wait to go back
I was very intrested in getting down to this place ever since my dear friends have been raving about it
Now i understand why they traveled all the way from the upper west side to this quaint little spot in the middle of no where
The food is outstanding, we started with a delicious artichoke salad and a wonderfull fresh pizza, this pizza is so unique words could not describe how simple and intresting it is
We then split a lasagna with wild boar meat , which also was so creative in its own unique way
I guess we should try some other dishes next time we get down that way, which will be soon i am sure
this restaurant puts their veal chop thats huge in a wood burning oven , sounded weird to me at first but after the first bite i was hooked
The iron plate they use to slide it in and out of the oven i am told sears it in a way that holds all the juices in, the result is amazing
the pizzas are also great with their own flavors from this oven
my new love is wood burning ovens
this was a perfect NY night, caught a great movie[raising victor vargas] at the sunshine and walked down the block to this wonderfull quaint italian restaurant
Very intamit and cozy, nice oven lets off warm glows through out the room, food was great, lasagna with vegetables was terrific, and also the whole fish, we also induldged in a serious torte caprese chocolate cake
it was nice to find this place that has no windows which you will never even notice because the room is so warm and inviting, you end up enjoying your company and a lovley dinner, very nice staff and very affordable wine list, mostly southern italian, dont miss the lasagna,
First we walked in 20 min late, they said dont worry, then my fish was a little under cooked, they took it off the bill with no attitude at all, then my girlfriend tasted 4 wines by the glass untill she was satisfied, again done with a smile and real concern, by the end of an amazing dinner the owner was talking with us making sure we were ok with everything , and that ended with him showing us pictures of the rest
before and how they built it, we felt so connected to this place after we left i had to write this so other owners might take notice and follow along, this concern goes along way, and so does their divine food
they took us with no problem,they are nice they are from the hood,and the pizza and salads are truley divine, good luck guys we loved it

At first i didnt know what to make of this place,it looks kind of new, kind of old , and i did not think the food would be as good as it was
Most places that look this cool do not have the food to go with it
We really enjoyed splitting a pizza margherita , and for entree i had a wonderfull veal chop, and my wife loved her wild boar lasagna,which we hear is their speacial dish
The portions are very big,consider splitting an entree
Being probably the oldest person in this place[50-something], i felt comfortable and definetly would dine here again
so nice to be in a place not every joe in the city knows about,, i am sure they will soon, food here to good to keep a secret
this is the first restaurant where we went from city search that the reviews where right on , everything was great , what a great find, order the meatballs to share , they are as big as your head
this place is so unexpected from outside
the minute i walked in i fell in love with it ,warmth is something you dont get from a brick and stone place
, but this place has this intense oven ,like a giant fire place, its so warm , and the food is great, i love peasant,so i knew the food would be great
went here with friends and was very impressed with the food
the pizza app was exellent, as was the striped bass special they had on that evening
the waiter was competent and attentive
cozy atmosphere, good place to bring a date,would definitely recommend it
this dish blew my mind,i never even heard of using wild boar in lasagna,it is soooo good, i guess that huge wood oven helps with that smokey flavor
people here were so cool
a nice change from all the cramped dark places down on ludllow st
lots of room and still cozy,i had the wild boar pasta and i cant wait to get it again, friends loved the pizza , great lighting
we loved this place except for the waiter who got just about everyones drink order wrong,and didnt even think anything was wrong with it,the food was delicious,especially the veal chop

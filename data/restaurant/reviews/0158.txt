My husband and I felt like the only ones in the full room
Wonderful little touches like an amuse-bouche to start the meal, and a final trio of sweets to complete it from the chef
Would absolutely recommend this gem!
Celebrated a very significant birthday here and it was a wonderful meal
Anita Lo is inventive and thoughtful with her dishes - the on the house treat that came before the meal was amazing! Apps came out nicely and the entrees were just as tasty
I recommend the trout entree if you like light fish
Overall the meal was enjoyable with comfortable space and good service
My only gripe is that the place looks like it needs renovations but that's just being nit picky
We had a lovely experience at Annisa
The host was so very kind
He knew we wanted a nice table and made a point to take good care of us
The food is elegant and tasty (fantastic martini too!)
The desserts are fantastic as well
All in all, Annisa is a beautiful, casual/elegant restaurant with excellent food and friendly service
my boyfriend surprised me on v-day with dinner at annisa, and i loved every minute of it
the atmosphere is cozy, not cliche or cheezy like many other restaurants with red hearts strewn everywhere
spacing between the tables was great and offered sufficient privacy
for me, the fact that it wasn't a huge restaurant was also very inviting
the food was excellent
the tuna appetizer was delicious, the lobster was succulent and perfect
the sea bass left something wanting
my b/f really like his filet mignon and hen
and the chocolate fondue was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal
the wait staff were friendly and patient, and the courses felt perfectly timed and not rushed at all
overall, it was a great evening, and i would definitely go there again
although given the high prices, that probably won't be anytime soon :)
Wow! Great service, a relaxed dining pace, excellent wine list, spicy flavorful combinations, and a soothing interior design
Annisa is one of those places in NYC that manages to hit all the high notes while avoiding the pitfalls of many other restaurants
The staff is pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful without being overbearing
The prices are reasonable
The food is great
A wonderful dining experience!
anita lo is amazing
i will try anything that she makes
she never disappoints
the restaurant is beautiful, and so is the food
she does a tremendous job
i also love the fact that anita actually cooks here, unlike so many other celebrity chefs
one of the best restaurants in new york
Annisa is, for me, a living room in foodie paradise
Soft tones, romantic, comfortable seating, carpeting to muffle the delicate clink of glasses
And some of the best food around: flavors that will give you flashbacks of childhood (I recall dishes that taste like times and memories; sorry to get so sentimental)
The chef so obviously cares deeply about her craft, that I am embarassed of my own lack of concern for what I do for a living
But I digress: Annisa will not disappoint
Quite simply, the best dining experience I've had in NYC
Better than Grammercy Tavern (which is great), than the funky boutique lower east side places, than Nobu
I particularly like the fact that it's not noisy and not bright, so my ears and eyes were not assaulted with sensory input - that was all left for my tastebuds
And they were given a real treat
Quite a rarity to find such friendly, efficient, unobtrusive service in NYC
A beautiful place in every respect
the space is beautiful and serene
the waitstaff were helpful and pleasant and the food was excellent
although many items on the menu catered to those who loved seafood i had an amazing beef dish
i would highly recommend coming here and will continue to patron this restaurant
Anissa has the most wonderful hostess/owner around
She owns and operates the spot with Anita Lo
The service is perfect and the food is interesting innovative and excellent
The summer menu is in play
much better than the winter menu
I recommend the Lobster entre and the steak
A very hip restaurant a true hidden treasure
You can always rely on the staff at Annisa to combine different tastes and textures, resulting in unique dishes full of flavor served with style and grace
Course 1: Sashimi scallops with caviar and tomalley
Amazing
2: Shanghai soup dumplings with foie gras
Not as good as last visit but still very yummy
3: Sable (black cod) with tofu and seaweed in miso broth
Great texture, beautiful flavor
4
Monkfish, smoked monkfish liver with choucroute
Wow! Never would have thought of it
5
Beef cheeks and tongue in bordelaise with wasabi mustard
Great depth of flavor, a bit chewy, a bit too gelatinous
6
Cheese plate
Hit or miss, overall yummy
7
INCREDIBLE dessert- Panna cotta with sherry reduction
Must have again NOW!
We loved the space and the hosts were quite nice
The food, however was a struggle
If you don't love fish, it's tough to find something on the menu
There were 4 of us at dinner and we all found the preparations all a bit complicated
The waitress saw a couple of us struggling with the menu and I felt she was frustrated with us
I'd hardly consider Annisa traditional
Great service and ambience; sophisticated in many ways
Food can be mixed
We have eaten there about 4 times
SOmetimes it is sublime and sometimes just good but that's not bad right?
I had the tasting menu on a first date
This was the ideal first date restaurant
We sat side-by-side in an intimate, but comfortable booth
The wine pairings with the food were uninspired, but fine
The menu began with a lot of promise
The first two courses were truly out of this world
The second two courses (the fish and meat) were boring and pretty flavorless
My date didn't even touch one of the courses
Dessert was ok, but nothing to write home about
All in all, I think we may have done better if we had just ordered a bunch of food off the menu

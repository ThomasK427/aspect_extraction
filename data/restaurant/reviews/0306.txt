All you can say is that they are beautifully decorated and the place is very clean
(You know, not a lot of Chinese restaurant is clean) However, I strongly recommend their Chinese dessert (Sweet Water, as they say in Cantonese)
This restuarant needs a lot of help
The experience started poorly as soon as we arrived because although the restaurant was not very busy, we were told to wait for a long time to be seated
The host and server were incredibly rude and unfriendly
The soup was bland; however, most of our entrees were fairly good, not spectacular
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown
Service was absolutely terrible and the food was unmemorable
The food took over an hour to arrive
Due to the bad service, I did'nt give any tip and the waiter still had the nerve to argue with me over it
Overall a terrible terrible dining experience
In Short Vintage Coca-Cola ads and posters of Life magazine covers succinctly summon up the 1950s, as do this diner's mini-jukeboxes, red vinyl counter stools and sock-hopping staff
Besides fast food staples like hot dogs, cheeseburgers, tuna melts and onion rings, options like the Streamliner (a grilled veggie patty) acknowledge more modern dietary concerns
Even better for kids, sandwiches come wrapped in paper jackets and nearly everything is served on paper plates
No spills
No breaks
No tears
I tried this place out, expecting it to be an average NYC diner
Although I was disappointed with the limited menu (just burgers and a couple sandwiches, that's basically it), it exceeded my expectations otherwise! My #12 burger was delicious and the fries were great too
Not normally crappy diner fries, and an above average burger
And the prices were fantastic, a great value! Got 2 burgers, 2 orders of fries, and 1 milkshake (which they split for us- 1 milkshake was more than enough for both of us) for $20
Good prices for NYC, anyway
:) And the service was EXCELLENT
We got the food so fast I coudn't believe it
And the waitress was so cute and friendly I practically wanted to eat her, too
This place has really good milkshakes
Skip the thin, runny ones at the Original NY Milkshake Company on St
Marks and get one here
It may be a chain but at least its good
And, its cheaper too!
I've had burgers at establishments all over the Northeast, and Johnny Rockets can't be beat for the quality of the ingredients
Every item on the burger is super fresh and delicious! No - they are not the 6lbs of beef that some NYC places give you - that's overkill in my opinion
For a killer meal, get yourself a #12 with chilly cheese fries and an authentic malt
You'll be stuffed to the gills
but best of all, your wallet wont' be drained! Rock on Johnny!
we had the nicest waitress, food was delicious, shakes were great !! yummmmm
the burgers are good here - even the chicken and turkey
the chili, milkshake and banana split are so-so
the staff is welcoming and friendly
the onion rings and french fries are ok if you like the kind that were frozen before
stick w/the burgers
and if you put Aretha Franklin's Respect on the jukebox, the staff will come out and dance for everyone - it's very entertaining! kids would love this place
Good freakin' burger! I mean, good freakin' burger! And I am not Vinny from Brooklyn! I know burgers!
In Short Hookahs and dim lighting evoke opium dens and harems
The staff is young and comely; the Middle Eastern pop music on the stereo is loud and fast
And just when you think a belly dancer is the only thing missing, voila: A scantily clad woman comes gyrating into the room
The menu includes the souk combination (tuna on a bed of vegetables), tagines, baklava and chocolate mousse cake
Went to Le Souk on a Saturday night with a group of about 10, mostly girls
Had to negotiate with the door man to get in without paying for an overpriced bottle of vodka
Even though we were buying drinks and a hookah, we kept getting kicked out of tables that were supposedly reserved for groups dropping huge amounts of cash
The music was great, and it was crowded (as can be expected in a Saturday night in NYC), but I probably wouldn't go back on a weekend night
I went there on a Thursday, 9:30pm
Wasn't overly crowded in the dining area, which was good as we were 1/2 past our reservation
Polite service all the way through
Food was delicious
The belly dancer (who was on her last run by now) was exceptionally beautiful and friendly
Afterwards we headed to the lounge and enjoyed the ambiance
It was very nice
When I went out for a smoke I noticed that the door policy had kicked in
Ladies were not having a problem at all, gentlemen seemed to be getting a bit more waiting time, but they were polite about it
I think this is a nice spot to have dinner and move to the lounge later with a date
I had my bday party here and it was a blast! Making reservations for 15 people was easy, and wait staff were very friendly and accomodating, and the place was pumping! The food is delicious, and I usually don't like Middle Eastern food, so that says a lot! The belly dancers were lots of fun, and the music is great to dance to
Plus, there's a downstairs part which has another DJ, and they also played great dance music
I highly recommend this place, as it's loads of fun and the staff is very friendly
WOW! This was my kind of place!! The kind of music in the main front room I could groove to all night long [if wearing appropriate heels] and beyond
Arabic music mixed with Latin music whether Rock en Espanol [you didn't play any last night
but I highly recommend] or Reggaton is definitely the way to get people jamming/happy
And
well
the drumming to accentuate and heighten the beats of the music was phenom!! Oh
the hookah was great
I LOVED the whole scene
count on me to revisit
Just a few suggestions: 1
Clean up your bathroom act
clean bathrooms reflect on your character as an establishment
2
May I suggest adding hookah to the reasons you would relinquish a table to patrons
saving tables for patrons willing to spend $200 and above on a bottle of something delish is going to be a tough sell
it just shows trying too hard to be something you're not
I'm a physician
still not willing to spend that
let people sit down
we'll write better reviews! Cheers! Great place overall---haven't tried the food
curious though!
This is one of my favorite spots in the city by far
I've been here over and over, and I have never been disapointed
Very international crowd, awesome music, and cheap drinks
Some people say it can be hard for guys to get in, but our friends have never had a problem so far
Unless you are into ethnic food such as this don't come
I mean the waiter was nice and helpful to explain all the items on the menu and the service was excellent but the food was nowhere near stellar
It was tasteless and way too spicy
Do not order the Mix Royale, it is totally horrible
I think the only thing my friend and I enjoyed was the dessert because after all how badly can you screw that up
This place is best for drinks only
I went to Le Souk with a group of friends
We had reserved space one one side of the bar, but when the staff tried to force the Pre-Fixe on all 15 members of the party to stay there, we moved to the other side (the difference in decor was minimal)
The food was very good, but the service was aweful
The waiter made no effort to remember who had orderd what (just threw it on the table and bailed), or even who ordered (I had to flag him so my wife could order her main dish 15 min after he had taken orders from others)
The music and belly dancing was indeed great, and would consider returning for drinks, but it is certainly not worth the wait of an hour or more

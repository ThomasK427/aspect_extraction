One of my favorites!
Its great to know you dont have to travel down to Little Italy for an experience like this! Its atmosphere is inviting towards large after-work clicks as well as dates
My girlfriend and I toasted our second anniversary to wonderfully prepared filet mignon and lobster ravioli--seasoned accordingly
Nothing was overdone; the mood, service and dinner set a tone that carried over even after we left
It was a glorious spot for our anniversary and also a destination for several dinners to come
My friends and I visited Andavi last evening for a birthday gathering
The food was absolutely delicious
For appetizers we shared bruschetta, garlic shrimp and fried calamari
The portions were large and the selections were very flavorful
My entree was the Chicken and Brie
Rarely do I feel compelled to rave about food at any restaurant, but this is one time I will
The dish was presented beautifully and was bursting with flavor
There was not one negative word at the table regarding anyone's entree
Great work, Andavi!
Awesome food
great music
funky decor
that is Andavi
My girlfriend and I had such a great time there last weekend
The wine list was very impressive and the food was the best I have tasted in most of the West Village
We are sure to make Andavi a regualr spot in the future
PS- Try the Salmon
It's the bomb

I loved the restaurant
Problem was I took my young sister and realized I went with the wrong person
The lighting as perfectly set for couples
The food was delicious, the pricing was very reasonable for the amount of food
The service was so good that I left a $20 bill for my waiter
Next time, I'll bring a date instead
Great spot
They offer a discount to all NYU students too! My girls and I absolutely couldn't leave until we finished harassing the cutie behind the bar! The food is tasty and the vibe is cool
I read past reviews for this place, and felt the need to check it out for  myself
I brought my date here last Tuesday and it's a pretty pleasant  difference; the place wasn't that packed when we arrived around 7pm-ish
It was,  however, a very memorable experience, especially the service
Jeff was the ideal  waiter; so cordial and generous that we considered staying to soak up his  catering all night
The owner Darcy came over and greeted us
Darcy, if you read  these, give Jeff a HUGE RAISE!!
After reading the rave reviews, I decided to check out Andavi last week, when I had friends visiting from abroad
We had such a wonderful experience from the moment we were greeted by the chic hostess, till we ended the evening with a delicious cappucino and a perfect creme brulee
The atmosphere was very cool
I loved the melow, candle lit, decor and the ambient music
I ordered the salmon, which was a great dish
All the portions were extremely large
I found the wait staff to be very friendly and helpful
I will definately be visiting Andavi again very soon and sharing this gem with my friends
I met my girlfriend at Andavi last night and I have to say that we were thrilled with our experience
Despite the fact that it was clearly a scene, our waiter gave us tons of attention and the food came out looking and tasting amazing
The portions definately were not heaping, but i'd never expect that from upscale food anyway
Our waiter actually substitued our wine (without charge) for a different kind when we admitted that we weren't crazy about it
Now that i've read the reviews, I can see that Andavi is not a secret!
My three sisters were in town last weekend for a family gathering, I took them here with my girlfriend on a friends recommendation
The most impressive aspect of our entire evening was the ease of which a party our size was serviced
The place was packed and we were seated promptly even without a reservation
The waiter catered our order very carefully, going out of his way to suggest which wine was best suited for each individual meal
The food was good, setting was tasteful and all in all we had a great time
I decided to visit Andavi on my birthday after reading all the positive reviews
The decor was lovely but unfortunately the service was not
One waiter took our drink order, but another appeared to tell us the specials and take our food order
chaos ensued, and it took forever to finally get our wine! The food wasn't impressive either- I was expecting huge portions, but my lobster ravioli was only 4 medium sized pieces, and I've tasted better at other restaurants
After waiting 20 minutes for our credit card to be picked up, my boyfriend and I left cash instead and got out of there!
I stumbled on Andavi last Saturday in the middle of the night
The last thing I expected to find on Christopher Street was a hip restaurant
Brings a little class to the neighborhood
But more importantly - from a gay boy's perspective, what eye candy
And not just the customers -  Darcy, hang onto that husband of yours - Boys: David is beyond hot!
I recently stopped by for lunch and had the clam chowder and lasagna
I've eaten a lot of clam chowders and I can honestly say Andavi's may be one of the best I've ever had
Both the chowder and lasagna were such hearty dishes
and for a fabulous lunch time price
The place is new so lunch wasn't so busy but I guarantee it will get busier because it's just too worth
Great food, great value, and service was extremely friendly and prompt
I dined here for the first time this past weekend and the food was delicious
There were a lot of attractive model-types seated around us
I had trouble focusing on my date! The portion sizes were more than I could eat, so my date barely made a dent in her main course
Suggestion: ask for appetizer-sized portions or split an entree
The outdoor garden was very pretty
We were equally impressed by with the service; the waiter tipped me off on the wine that best complimented our orders
The food was pretty good and I wouldn't mind paying another visit at all
Andavi makes having pasta for dinner worth all those carbs! While the service is fast, the dining area was somewhat small
I will definitely return
I've been by this place a few times since it has opened and the food has been consistently solid
I hit it wrong on one night when they had a new cook in the kitchen who didn't quite understand how I wanted my food prepared, so, when I complained, one of the owners pushed the cook aside and made it herself with me watching on
She looks too young to own the place, and too young to cook well, but she nailed it - even in her high heels
I'm going to go back again to see if I can get a repeat performance
An impressive save, to say the least
No waiters with attitude here
Genuine smiles and effort go into the service
I've been there 3 times and have had a good experience each time
The food is well prepared and the wine list, although somewhat basic, has something for everyone
I know what most of the bottles go for on the wholesale level and can say that their mark-up is as reasonable as I've ever seen
The food was great
The presentation was impressive
I enjoyed the varied chill-out music that was pumping in the background
I made the mistake of taking my 11 year old daughter for lunch here at Andavi
While it doesnt cultivate a kids friendly atmosphere, the ambiance is just right for my next date! Very well prepared cuisine and service is friendly and courteous
I had the fettuccini alfredo; it tasted like it was delivered in from the old country

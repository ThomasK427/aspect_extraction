This is where the good luck stopped
The waiter was one of the rudest and least attentiveI have ever had the misfortune of having (and being a former waitress, I know how hard this job can be)
He was impatient, ignored our questions and slammed down the food
The food itself was one-note Italian--all the pasta dishes were covered in the same hardened cheese and bland marinara sauce
The meat and vegetables were extremely greasy and flavorless
Only the dessert was good
Bringing it back to old school italian comfort food
Meatballs bigger than your momma ever made
For the vegetarians out there try the spinach lasagna or the eggplant rollattini
Too cap off the night I had this dessert they call Dulce Apizz, two words A Mazing
Overall this place is a hidden treasure in the heart of the lower east side
Apizz is one those restaurants that you feel like you have discovered and can't wait to tell friends about
It's a cozy, one story place on Eldridge Street with phenomenal food
I took my girlfriend there on Thursday night and went back with my parents on Sunday and it was the perfect place for both
The meatballs are the best I have had in the city
my girlfriend loved the lamb chops
Check it out!
On a recommendation, celebrated a friend's birthday here and had a wonderful time
Off the beaten path, but the better for me to keep as my little secret;-) The place is very cozy
Very romantic! The host and the staff were prompt, very attentive, and unobtrusive
The food was excellent! I started with the baked calamari(mmm!), a grilled steak w/arugula, tomato and onion entree and dessert was a fruit tart
along with a sampling of everyone else's goodies
Couldn't help myself
Definitely, a satisfying food experience! Now I just need to find a date;-)
It's a shame that a place this beautiful and with a great menu has to have such mediocre food
I'm a big fan of their sister restaurant Peasant but unfortunately Apizz is missing the mark
The apizz's individual pizzas that are the restaurant's namesake are not very good
The crusts are not crisp enough and the toppings and sauce are uninspired and bland
The salads and other dishes were also bland
Everything was in need of a touch of salt or a bit of spice
I love the idea of their Bread being served with sides of fresh ricotta and tomato sauce but even here the sauce needs a little kick (garlic, salt, basil - something!)
Too bad because the service was good enough and the place is very cozy
I'd recommend Serafina over Apizz (and I HATE Serafina!)
Up and coming is understating the obvious for this cozy Italian restuarant
I was told about the centerpiece, a giant brick oven, in an about the new york grapevines and decieded to check it out
Graciously greeted by the doorman I entered this short hallway making me feel like celebrity
Hosts immediatly make eye contact, giving you a familiar experience
Rustic, elegantly warm mohagany essence fills the room
The host escorted me to our seats and we were delighty with our view of chefs preparing assisted by a massive brick oven
The food exquiste, service immaculate
another surprise was the lounge downstairs
A perfect place to get a glass of white and unwhind
Apizz hit the spot
The Scene The restaurant's popularity is due in no small part to co-owners John McDonald and Steve Hanson, who've brought their mix of PR buzz and exquisite design sense to this sprawling space
It feels more intimate than its 250 seats, thanks to a series of cutout screens and a cluster of whimsical hanging lanterns made from tree trunks
The Food Guacamole is made tableside, so you can dictate just how spicy you want it
The kitchen satisfies with starters like rich tostaditas with avocado and chipotle-tomato-roasted pork and lighter, yet just as flavorful, soft tacos with grilled sea bass
Main courses are hit-or-miss, although fans of shellfish will be pleased by both the lobster tumbada, a dish similar to paella, and the garlic-lime-marinated grilled shrimp
The strawberry-basil margarita is deliciously sweet and tangy, while the frozen prickly pear version is deceptively potent
I make my own guacamole, and this one stunk
Weird flavor in all their food
Decor was gorgeous
food was not good
On July,21/2006 I was there with some of my friends and the Manager cecilia was very rude and unproffessional
she aproach us inreference to vacating the table by 8:30pm
According to cecilia the waitress asked us on four occassions that the table was needed by 8:30pm, which was a lie
Cecilia the manager attempted to intimidate us by getting the bouncer after we spended $800
Note we went back an hour later and the table was still empty
So if you go to dos caminos make sure celilia is not there
she is very rude and extremetly UNPROFESSIONAL
Since me and my gf work in the restaurant bussiness, we like to try new restaurants all the time, its our passion
DC has been our favorite spot for a while now
We love the interior, very romantic and different
The good food and the attentive service make the whole experience in DC wonderful
They have the best guacamole in NYC (we are hard to impress)
We recommend this place either for bussiness meetings, a date or special occasions
This restaurant is complete
Congruatulations to the Corporation, you are doing a really good job
My husband I visited Dos Caminos last weekend and were very impressed by the quality and presentation of the food
It wasn't only delicious but the atmosphere was very pleasant
If I had known this was a br guest affiliated restaurant I would have said no thank you
All these places are the same
The training that they offer their staff, and to get the service we did the other day was embarassing to say the least
We waited over 15 minutes for our guacamole (lunch time not very busy around 2pm) then our waitiress comes to the tabe and says om my your main courses aren't out yet??? it's been a while
i should probably check on them for you friend asks for sour cream 10 minutes later it arrives
Our waitress dissapears more than once
the manager is now taking our dessert order
When it's time for change she breaks 2 20's in all 5 dollar bills
I was mortified
The food was mediocre
bland
taste less
much much better places in the city for mexican!
Great margaritas (especially the prickly pear), and the handmade guacamole is delicious
Just stay away from the spicy guacamole because it's super hot! This place has a young crowd and it is a great place to eat though it's a bit pricey
Great ambience, attentive servers and GREAT food/ (incredibly strong) but good drinks, though not as conducive for a large group! Sea bass melts in your mouth, prickly pear frozen margaritas are highly recommended, queso appetizer is to die for, chocolate fondue dessert is en pointe
We highly recommend Dos Cominos! My wife chose it for our anniversary recently and we were knocked out by the quality of food service here for our buck
The mains were a little on the small side but so tasty
The fresh guacamole was so nice
The cocktails were mixed nicely
The sexy ambience was very fitting for a Valentine's Day dinner
The tree trunks hanging from the ceiling help to give this place character
We were seated promptly along the wall, which wasnt the best because we were almost shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors
The server was not personable, but that did not stop him from giving us great service
He steered us clear of some unpopular drinks and was very attentive
The food was incredible! We had the tableside guac which was great (and I am not a fan of avocado)
We followed this up with shrimp empanadas, then the mahi mahi and a shrimp and scallop tomato based dish for entrees
We washed the food down with mojitos and the red and the white sangria
I give this place a thumbs up!
It was my first time going to a Mexican Restuarant, and I loved every bit about it

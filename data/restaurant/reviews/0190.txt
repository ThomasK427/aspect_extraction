I was very disappointed to have to take this one off of my favorites list
since it looks like everyone's already familiar with the rude hostess and long wait for a table (even with a reservation), i'll skip that part
once seated, however, i didn't expect the wait to continue
it took 3 hours (!) for our tiny dishes of sushi to come out
they gave us 1 miniature bottle of champagne to compensate, but by then i had already lost my appetite
the fish was not fresh and didn't taste very spectacular
needless to say, i won't be going back
Go there if you want to impress your wife (or girlfriend)
This place will sure hit your wallet, but you'll be so happy, you'll hardly notice it
The food is exceptional, the service is great and the atmosphere is all you want for the romantic dinner
Not being an expert in Japanese food I ordered 7-course omakase with wine pairings
And that was a good decision: drinks and dishes are relatively small (basically, samplers), so you don't end up drunk or eat too much, but will get a good idea about their cooking abilities
I'll definitely go there again
The website advertises a free pastry basket with brunch, but our waitress told us this was not the case
Other than that, the ambience (upstairs) makes you feel like you're in a different city great and the food is yummy
Not cheap for what you get though
Its hard to imaging how a restaurant with sushi in their name can serve such mockery of sushi
Fish fresh, but the cuts are poor, and the rice feels like its make of wax, and more at home in Madame Toussads
Non-sushi foods are tolerable, but by no means good
Drinks are excellent
A few stiff drinks and the beautiful people MAY make the otherwise unpalatable food tolerable
The food and drinks here are fantastic
I used to love this place up until last night when I went with a large group of friends
We were a party of 7 and the service we received was terrible
Two people in our group did not receive their appetizers until after the rest of us had finished
Our entrees took over 2 hours for them to serve and most of us simply ordered sushi rolls
After the first hour we were given repeated assuarances that our food would be out in 5 minutes
I will give them credit for trying to make it right by offering free desserts and free shots
After all this, they still had the gall to add an 18% tip to our tab!
I went to Sushi Samba (NY
Village) with my friends on Saturday night
We had a great time
The food was great! A combination of Sushi and Latin American Dishes
We tried their new menu that just started last Wednesday a combination of 4 different kind of ceviches and 4 kinds of Tiradito, of course you can't go wrong with spicy Tuna Rolls and The Peruvian Corn mmmm! I can't wait to taste it again
One of my favorites Yellow Tail Ceviche;
Drinks were flowing
caipirinhas (Brazil), Mojitos (Cuba) and The vibe was so cool
The Roof deck is amazing which let you enjoy the city even more
Definitely a place to come back
my husband and I went to Sushi Samba LAST YEAR to celebrate our 9 year anniversary
we had such a great time that we decided we would return this year to celebrate our 10th year together
our waiter from last year, a young man named Chris, actually remembered us (we did speak at length that evening about everything from food and wine to how to create good marrige)
even though he wasn't our waiter that evening, chris had 2 glasses of champaigne sent over to our table and later on the manager sent over a desert with a candle in it and congratulated us
these guys our great and really made us feel that they appreciated us being there
and, the food is always wonderful too
Sushi Samba honored our reservations punctually seating the 4 in my party at a booth
I ordered the El Topo roll
I liked the crisp onions on top mixed with the jalapenos and shiso leaves
You can't go wrong with the spicy tuna rolls either
A good ambiance and a trendy crowd
Will go back
Sushi Sambas is without a doubt my favorite place to be, whether its for dinner or just to grab a drink
Reasonably priced, the setting is beautiful w/ a crowd equally as attractive
The waiting staff is very polite and courteous making every visit just as memorable as the last
definitely make reservations, if possible try to reserve a spot on the rooftop and you will see why i love it so much
I have Recommended this place to everyone i know!
Its no wonder that trendy scene-sters at this place are usually thin - they make you wait almost 2 hours for a table to eat! I guess their plan is to overbook, even when they take reservations, and then try to keep you occupied by a too-sweet free round of drinks that I can only describe as scary
On top of which, the waiter doesn't write down your order, the busboy brought us the wrong food 3 times, and there's barely any room while you're waiting to sit and have a drink
Downstairs might be fun for a cocktail but waiting in line to check in at a restaurant, waiting 2 hours for mediocre sushi, and paying for the scene and trendiness are not worth it
Go to Nobu
Its much more of a scene and if you have a reservation they honor it
Agreed great atmosphere and drinks, BUT
be prepared to wait over an HOUR 1/2 to be seated! Made reservations for 4 over a month ago
Upon our arrival, we had to wait in an extremely long line just to check in w the hostess
This took 20 minutes! We were told the table was on dessert and it would be a few moments
Well, 2 hours later we were seated
The one redeeming quality, was the bartender who made us delicious exotic drinks as we waited
The waiter sensed our angst and got us free appetizers and drinks immediately
Yet, he didnt write down our food order and got it wrong 2x
NOT RECOMMENDED unless you make a dinner reservation and plan on eating breakfast
but overall, we really enjoyed our experience
We were told there would be a 10minute wait for a table, but ended up sitting at the sushi bar instead
Our server (Elliot) was excellent, extremely helpful and knowledgeable, gave us great suggestions on the menu
He even comped our dessert, which was also fantastic
The music is definitely a bit loud, and it does have a scene-y feel
Overall, I would recommend it
Ask to be seated in Elliot's section!
there were 8 of us with reservations and they sat us in a booth that barely fits 6
bill came out to $600 including tip
i had 5 of their 'special' drinks and did not feel a thing
ordered their empanadas and it tasted horrible
ordered one of their 'special' rolls for $20 and it was only 3 pieces and it didn't taste very good
Service was good but music was rather loud
japanese with s
american flair is not a good mix
I've been here a few times and always enjoyed every visit
Great selection of food and drink items
An ideal place to come as a group tho it gets noisy and too packed at times
The trendy atmosphere, music and good conversation will make you forget that your bill has sky-rocketed because of too much saki
Way too tight! Came out here from Los Angeles for the weekend
Sushi Samba is highly recommended
Although it is a bit pricey for two people, the vibe and the service make up for it
L
A
needs a spot like this! Mahalo cuz
the food was pretty good and the drinks were amazing
The staff was very helpful and nice, especially our waiter who came to our table many times to see if we needed anything or to ask if the food was good
We didnt have to wait for long either
The ambience of the place put us all in good moods
The food and drinks were somewhat pricey but def

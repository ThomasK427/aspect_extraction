The staff was very friendly and the food was AWESOME!!!!! I've got to tell my friends about this place
When on the east side, visit this John's location
I would put it up there with Grimaldi's in Brooklyn
The crust is very doughy and the cheese and sauce is great
Usually I visit Patsy's when looking for a great slice but John's is better
It's hard to find good pizza in Manhattan
Best rye bread on the planet
The heavily-seeded rye is the standard against which all other bread is judged
I grew up on this bread, and a recent visit happily confirmed that the breads and the bakery haven't changed a whit
The dense, dark, almost caramelized-tasting raisin pumpernickel is true bread perfection, as is the rye and corn rye
The Scene It may lack the eclat of his patisserie, but Francois Payard's adjoining bistro is just as much of a destination
Designer David Rockwell's decor exhibits belle epoque flair, with fanciful blown-glass lighting fixtures and colorful striped banquettes
Tables set with Bernardaud china and Masa linens enhance the elegance
The Food Chef Philippe Bertineau takes classic bistro cuisine to the next level
His celery root, chestnut and mushroom soup is velvety smooth, with duck confit adding both texture and a welcome touch of salt; twice-baked cheese souffle is as pretty as a dessert, enrobed in a silken cloak of Parmesan cream sauce and truffle oil
Entrees are equally impressive, each dish carefully accompanied by seasonal sides
The duo of pheasant arrives with Hokkaido squash, baby brussels sprouts, black trumpet mushrooms and Fuji apples; the venison has just as many co-stars, to equally impressive effect
Finish with the justly famous hot chocolate souffle
Payard is an excellent bakery and restaurant
It is high quality french food
For the appetizer, they have a great cheese souffle! The Rocher Noir (dark chocolate crispy)chocolates are amazing as well! And if you like french fries, they have the best! The people who work there are very nice
I would defenitely recommend it!
I really enjoyed payard immensely
The ambiance is cool and private, even though you're not too far from the next table
The service is EXCELLENT, well versed about the menu, suggested wine pairings, and considerate
I loved the food- rich, delicate, and delicious
I especially enjoyed the pan seared scallops with tapioca! Don't skip dessert- they're just as well prepared as the food is
My fiance and I went to Payard for Valentine's Day
While I favor the food at Fauchon, the overall experience at Payard was amazing
The food was good (small portions) but the service and the ambiance/vibe/atmosphere was electric
You could tell everyone wanted to be there
I guess we were a couple of the lucky ones
Pros: Service, Atmosphere, Location Cons: Portion size Overall user rating:Recommended
Went with my boyfriend and tried their five-course tasting menu
It was unbelieveable, each dish better than the last and the four desserts at the end were heavenly
Our waiter (as well as the rest of the staff we encountered) were fantastic, made wonderful suggestions about wines that would complement the dishes, and was very knowledgeable about the menu
A perfect date place
One of the best meals of my life, can't wait to go back!
I had been longing to visit Payard, so when this recent opportunity arose, I could barely stand it! I went on a Saturday and had the $29 price fix lunch
What a deal! The lentil soup, the pork duo and the creme brulee that I had were all fabulous
The service was better than expected
The bakery in the front was out of this world! Treat someone special to this place, whether it be yourself or a special someone, it will be greatly appreciated
Payard: dazzling, delightful, and very charming
The ambience was mesmerizing with lighting and seating that were warm soothing
While not a quiet place, the hum that infused the restaurant was more of a convivial buzz than a disruptive din
Our waiter was sophisticated and sweet, offering prompt and friendly service
As we dined there during restaurant week, I expected to have a very limited selection, but instead faced a panoply of sumptuous selections, from three appetizers (I went for the salmon tartare), to two entrees-roast chicken or dourade, and ANY dessert we wanted from the patisserie out front
Needless to say, I was in gastronomic heaven
My boyfriend and I beamed all night, as smitted with Payard as with each other
To top it all off, our Sancerres were on the house! Can't wait for our next special rendez-vous at my new NYC favorite: Payard!
I was worried when I saw the last review, but was here a year ago and had a blast, made a client lunch reservation for 6 today
My only complaint is the acoustics
other than that, what a blast we had! It was packed and noisy, but full of joie de vivre
The food was still spectacular, as was the wine, and isn't that what counts? Marisol at the front desk is serviceable; our sommelier, though not French, knew his Bordeaux, and our server was delightful
There were smiles all around, and no guilt over the calories
Can't believe I had such phenomenal bouillabaisse in the winter
cheese souflees were spectacular; steak au poive was above average; snapper was over the top
Have fun!
What happened to the staff at Payard
The French ambience is gone and so is the maitre'd
We kept coming back because of the two Philippe's (Kitchen and Dining room), the food is still superior but unfortunately the ambience has been replaced by dull and boring
The new maitred' might as well be a cardboard cut out behind his desk
Don't ask him any questions about the menu or wine, he doesn't know nor does it seem like he cares
the attitudes soar as high as the ceilings in this vaunted upper east side haunt
The host and server staff seem to have forgotten that the customer is king
The food is good, the desserts are beautiful (invariably not as tasty as they appear), and the Italian ices are yummy
The high prices and chilly attitudes though are enough to turn me off
We live nearly next door and no longer frequent this expensive spot
During a recent visit to the city, my husband and I ate at the bistro
Everything was fabulous
The service could not have been better
Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing
He graciously explained items on the menu and when we finally decided on desserts, he brought us another that we had been thinking about -- on the house
He also brought over a sampling of desserts to take home to our children--again, on the house
The food was excellent
The ambience was casually elegant, not stuffy
Tables were very close together
We ate at an early hour (6pm), but even as we left, and the tables were mostly filled, it was not unbearably noisy as I find many restaurants to be
We were seated near the entrance and it appeared as if they treated each patron as a special guest
We will definitely be coming back!
After waiting over an hour for our dinner, we were finally able to get someone's attention to ask what was going on
The waiter told us that he had checked with the kitchen because he noticed that we had not gotten our dinners and they said it would be out shortly, shouldn't someone have said something to us? When we spoke to the manager he told us that there was nothing he could do and no one else there that we could speak with
After we paid and had our coats on and were walking toward the door he offered us dessert, but frankly it was already 10pm and I really didn't have the time to wait for dessert
The only thing I would recommend here is to take out dessert
This small patisserie has a take out bakery, a small cafe with tables literally on top of each other in the front of the restaurant and a small bar area, and a more spacious restaurant with a balcony in the back
We had pastries and hot chocolate at the bar on a bustling Saturday afternoon
The staff have been described as being rude and terse here but they were very efficient and some were less reserved
Eat at the bar if you can, as the bartender is great and you may feel less squeezed in
The pastries (and the hot chocolate) were all above average including the Notre Dame, apple and banana tarts
The Mille Feuille was only average though
If you want a great dessert, Payard's is the place to go! We tried the 5 course tasting menu and the food was as great as the 4 desserts we got to sample
The restaurant packs as many tables into the space as possible so we were quite close to our neighbors but the food and service was so great we barely noticed!
I loved the food and would have enjoyed the service even more if it were not for one comment I recieved
It was the best service I ever had in a New York restaurant, all except for one person
But in life everything is not perfect
I went to Payard to enjoy the Winter Restaurant Week and after being served a second helping from the bread basket
I was told that it would be my last since I had ordered from the $35 prix fixed menu
My dinner companion was extremely embarrassed and many people sitting near by had over heard this rude comment
Dessert is on the house but extras on a dinner roll is not
I had never been to Payard Bistro before until my friends recommended it

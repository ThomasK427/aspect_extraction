AND we were still hungry so we went to Gray Papaya afterwards!
The best West Indian roti in Manhattan
It hard to find this type of cooking in the city without heading out to the West Indian neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn
A fantastic addition to the neighborhood
My only complaint is that they do not sell the roti individually
It is rare you find two great types of food in one restaraunt! A wonderful and friendly husband and wife opened this small quaint place and it's like you're getting a home cooked meal
The curry goat is flavorful and very spicy (like I said this is home-cooked) while the ribs are tender with a snappy sauce
If you love soul food try the herb baked chicken with some collard greens
Great food and wonderful service
Tried the curry chicken roti wrap to go
The best you'll ever have
Very nice couple that own the restaurant
While it may not look like much from the outside, this delicious food and friendly service MORE than makes up for anything that might be missing
The curry chicken roti wrap and jerk chicken are great (although be prepared for your mouth to burn!), and it really makes you feel like you're eating a home-cooked meal
I would recommend this to anyone!
Nero has the best brunch deal in town! $20 gets you a great meal and all you can drink mimosas, bellinis, etc
Perfectly located on the corner of Little West 12th, you can sneer at all the suckers at Pastis paying double for their brunch
The wait staff is friendly and never questioned our three hour brunch (an obvious abuse of 'all you can drink')
The best part is
the food is good too (and the portions hearty enough to sustain an afternoon of all you can drink)
First of all the location is excellent, right in the heart of the Meatpacking district
Stepping into this place takes you away from New York
we really felt like we were right in Italy
The staff are kind and attentive, but not annoyingly so
The food, wine, dessert, atmosphere were all amazing
Try the Gamberetti appetizer! Great exposed brick walls, and the tables are made of dark wooden planks
So very cool
Love this place and intend to go back many times
My experience at Nero was absolutely superb! I've been to a plethera of places in this area where the air is full snobbery, and the waiters stick up their noses wondering whether or not you're worthy of eating there
Not at Nero
Upon entering Nero, I was given a warm welcome by the host and was immediately ushered to a table
I didn't wait more than one minute before water, bread and oil were sitting on the table along with the menu and wine list
The wine list is quite extensive and perhaps a bit overwhelming for some
No worries though! Nero has a charming sommelier to help you with your choice
And the food, you ask? Delicious
Finally, a place where we weren't rushed out the door on a Saturday night and were allowed to enjoy ourselves to the enth degree
Bravo, Nero!
My wife and I have been to Nero several times and we are foodies when it comes down to spending money in a very competitive and expensive city such as NYC
Well, Nero its been satisfactory every time we visited
The menu offers great variety, authentic Italian flavors and good presentation
They have an Italian Chef, whom we were introduced to, who seems to be very keen on carrying on tradition but also experiment a little with the evolution of todays Italian cuisine
The owners, always present and attentive, are from Rome and Naples and one of them is also the wine director that put together a very interesting and wallet friendly, all Italian wine list
The ambiance is great, although we prefer to go during the week to avoid the weekend bar scene, which can be a little loud
I ate here with some friends last weekend
The service was good, and the space was nicely lit--a great place to have a bottle of wine
The food was perhaps the worst I've had in the city
The duck was nothing more than a lightly seered huhk of gamey, sinuous mush, served on a bed of grits
It was almost nausea-inducing
The pasta was nothing special
Fruit in the deserts was still slightly frozen in the center
And trust me, I don't even have the most onerous standards--dinner just sucked
If you're going for a meal, save some time and go somewhere that doesn't depend upon the draw of the Meatpacking district to market its subpar food
It took them 30 minutes to bring our food and we were the only table indoor
When the food arrived it didn't even look like the way it sounded on the menu
One dish we order was Truffle eggs but it look more like plain fried eggs there was no truffle at all
The other dish was chocolate french toast
It was a plain french toast with fruits and maple syrup
We ask the waiter where's the chocolate? 1st he said it was inside the french toast then he said it was mix in with the maple syrup
Finally, someone bring us a side of chocolate sauce and put some truffle on the fried eggs
They have to pay more attention to patrons
Cool atmosphere, good service but, I wouldnt call it italian!
steak house with italian edge maybe
Mostly steak
t-bone, porterhousefor 2, lamb chops, Veal etc
I guess the small pasta selection makes this italian
Steak was WELL done when I asked for medium
Good wine selection
Kind of average, so , so place, but cool atmosphere
Nero has the best bar in the MPD to saddl up to and meet some friends for happy hour right out of work
I, myself, work right around the corner and me and my friends love it
The bartenders are attentive and pay close attention to detail
Girls love the martinis while guys love watching the girls sip such grand libations
Great scene w/o the scene
Their menu is strong as I like bringing clients in there for informal meetings
This is a little gem in the Meat Packing District
Better then Vento across the street! Prices are great, not that expensive but the quality of food screams for high prices
Our group agreed the food is very different but amazingly sensitive to our palates
The wine ist goes on and on
I recommend the burrata and the black cod
I have already been there 5 times in two months
PS- I just went for brunch on Saturday and the eggs served with onions and rosemary were amazing
This has all around become my favorite restaurant
I cannot complain about anything except maybe that I wish there was more seating outside
found this newcomer and got great pasta and lamb - great crowd - really cool music and vibe - near to all
we wound up moving to the bar afterward and enjoyed wine and tunes
love the dip served with bread
I went to Nero over the weekend by chance and was thoroughly surprised
It was very cozy and we were able to sit outside
This is a great restaurant to make a regular spot with its easygoing atmosphere and service staff
No pretense
I started with a salad and had a fish special which was delicious
The portions were perfectly sized and I loved the fresh seasonings and garnishes on all
It reminds me of a Tuscan restaurant I have visited many times before
The crowd wsa a complete mix, from casual to super hip
Very enjoyable
I have been to Nero 3 times so far and am always pleased
The portions are perfectly sized, the wine list superb (Valpollicello for $40
! amazing), ambiance and music = super hip
The bar crowd is packed and the staff seem to find you wherever you are once your table is ready
I had a grilled fish special with spinach which was among the best I have had yet

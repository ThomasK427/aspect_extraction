I've been to rare may times
When i go at night the bar is usually packed with gorgeous women which makes the wait for a table seem small
Althought the food takes some time to get to the table, it is well worth the wait
Rare's variety of burgers is unmatched by any other spot in the city
the people who have written poor food reviews obviously have alterior motives
For burgers and a great place to meet women Rare and Rare View is the place to be
Service was awful! If it had been crowded it would have been understandable but we had to flag down a waiter just to get a glass of water
The waitress was rude when asked where our food was and then to top it off we were overcharged! If the menu lists a price - that is the price - not some other number
The most confusing thing - the manager refused to come speak with us when we asked the waitress to have him come over
I spoke with him on the way out and he seemed to be suprised that I thought that was strange
While the burgers were good, I can make better at home, and certainly don't need the rude treatment and poor service at Rare
I will not be back
Went to lunch with a colleague and was seated promptly
After that it took over an hour for our lunch and the restaurant was not crowded
Mine burger was underdone and my colleauge's overdone
When the bill came it said that one of the things we ordered was $12, the menu listed it as $9
The restaurant apparently changed the price but did update the the menu
We tried to get the manager who flatly refused to come to our table and discuss the problem with us
We ended up having to follow him into the bar area
I want to bet that all the good reviews were written by the owner
Seriously, I've been here 2 times - for lunch and for happy hour on the roof
Lunch: we were all excited for the best burger ever and we all walked away saying that they were just ok and extremely slow (it was almost a 2 hour lunch)
Needless to say we never went back
Roof: very nice space (although I know 5 other rooftop bars just as good), but the crowd was a bunch of posers and the owner was a tool
Give a geeky guy a popular bar and watch him start thinking he is the coolest
Apparently they are too hot to reserve space for birthday parties (even though it could've brought them in a ton of money and publicity = short-sighted)
All in all I left with a bad vibe
Man, I was really impressed with Rare and Rare View
FYI, Rare has the best burger I have had in a long time (blows corner bistro away) and the scene in this place was awesome
Hot chicks EVERYWHERE and great service too! I was also impressed with how friendly the owners of this place were which is a rare find in this city! This place is no doubt going to be my new spot to chill, Rare and the roof (Rare View) are the bomb!
Superb is the only word to describe my experience at Rare
Delicious food, exemplary service and incredible ambiance
Before dinner we had drinks at Rare View on the roof which has an amazing view of the city and is the quintessential place to share cocktails with friends! Rare and Rare View are absolutely great additions to the Murray Hill neighborhood!
I cannot say enough about how fantastic Rare is! The food is phenomenal, the service is outstanding the atmosphere cannot be beat
It is very difficult to find a restaurant with a cool vibe, absolutely no pretension and superb food
The crowd was a great mix of people too
I was very impressed with Rare and loved their roof deck, Rare View (amazing views of the city!) I absolutely recommend this place
I'm shocked at the negative reviews of this place
They are completely erroneous
I have to say this is absolutely the best burger I have had in NY or anywhere else
The food was amazing, the service terrific and the fries were the BEST! My friends and I have been to Rare on many occastions and each time is better than the last!
Hands down, Rare has the best burgers in town
Not only was the food incredible but the service was great too
The french fry sampler was amazing! Clearly the owners of this establishment know what they are doing bc the place was packed and buzzing
It's refreshing to find a restaurant with a cool vibe, delicious food and friendly service
I will definitely be back
Rare is truly one of the best restaurants that I have been to an a long time
I went with a group of friends who all agreed! The service was extremely friendly, ambience was impressive and the food was fabulous
The burger trio was delicious, a must try! After dinner we had drinks at Rare View on the roof and the view was incredible the scene was amazing
We will absolutely be back!
Truly the best burgers in the city! I have never seen such an amazing variety of burgers
I was with a group of friends and we each tried a different burger
The kobe burger and the crab burger were so unique and delicious
I will definitely be back to try all the rest! It is refreshing to find a place where the service is both curteous and friendly
Without doubt an enjoyable experience that I look forward to repeating!
I met a group of friends at Rare, because Rare View was closed due to rain
None of us were able to get drinks in a timely fashion, and the bartender was EXTREMELY rude to us
I have been a bartender and a server, so I pride myself in understanding the plight of those in these industries
There is never an excuse for a bartender to yell at a patron, and then ask for an additonal tip!
Rare's burger is pitiful
No exaggeration
Dry and tasteless meat
Their burger is not even in the *ballpark* of Corner Bistro
You're better off going to Wendy's, for god's sake
I can't believe some of the positive reviews I'm reading on this site
Also, the fries are sorry
They were soggy -- drenched in oil [hint to kitchen staff: raise the temperture on your frier]
However, the redhead bartender is way cute and very friendly
A friend told me about Rare, decided to see what it was all about
I ordered the regular burger and my friend ordered the kobe burger
It was great, cooked just as I ordered medium rare
Sevice was excellent
After dinner went to the roof for a nightcap
The view was fantastic as was the people there
Nice music too
I must go back because this place is really a gem
I think the bugers here are much better than at Corner Bistro
Flavorful, juicy, inventive
i like the chicken burger
the new bar on the roof-- Rare View is STUNNING!! a must see
amazing view
great drinks
The only thing hotel about this burger joint is the entrance
With a dark, sexy ambiance and buzzing small bar chatter, the atmosphere is surprisingly sharp
Tight quarters when your table is ready, although not uncommon to the Manhattan dinner crowd, and an impersonal wait staff may ruffle the feathers of the particular guest
The burgers are big and juicy, with a variety of flavors and opportunities
The female I was with was disappointed in the Frickles (fried pickles), thinking they were going to be french fry pickles, when in fact they were more like fried pickle dumplings
To be fair, we went after a stressful day at work, and although we enjoyed ourselves, we would probably have been better served at a more quiet, intimate location
Definitely a must stop on the Manhattan burger circuit
The Rare View bar on the roof of the hotel
magnificent outdoor venue
This is a great restaurant
Problem is some people complain about service
This place is hot and service can be slow
Actually the wait is worth it
Every good restaurant in town has slow service when they're busy
Be prepared for slow service on a busy night
But enjoy the ambience , the music etc etc
I love this place
Best hamburgers in town, best atmosphere, Best ambience

The gelato is horrible, it taste like they bought it from Key Food
They should name the place PU bello because it stinks
They offer great food at inexpensive prices
The desserts are to die for
They seriously rival serendipity's
The decor is not much so, don't expect anything close to fancy
Instead it's like a 90210 Peach Pit with fabulous dessert
Don't order the pasta, it's mediocre
I would order things like calamari though
The more expensive entrees are much better
A must stop but only if you're already in the neighborhood
I love this restaurant
the portions are not large, but extremely filling somehow
the service was impeccable and the general feel of this restaurant is so romantic and nice
The 2 times I have been there have both been pleasant experiences
The service is impeccable, the food is delicious
The specials of the day are the way to go
twice! The food was average (and that's being kind) and the service was horrible
I won't go back again
Restauarant is set to 1950's theme but really needs renovation and maintenance prehaps an update in decor
Broken window was covered with wood
Good value for breakfast
i think friends coffee shop makes great food the service is great and they are very poilte i think that they should open more because there the best food store i ever ate from the food is addicting and you cant stop eating because it so delious
This place is a rip off
The food is quite pedestrian and the attitude from the staff is very snobby
Six dollars for a small pellegrino in Forest Hills???????????? Who you kidding
Food was pretty good! Thai/French Fusion--didn't know they went together
Nice atmosphere, kinda jazzy
A little pricey for Thai food but was real good! My bf had filet mignon with a mushroom gravy
He doesn't like mushrooms and ate it all!!! I told him after he was done that he had mushrooms and he was shocked! I had chicken in a garlic sauce- I played it safe
Not too many options on the menu
Very romantic, dim lighting, nice music, polite staff, very quaint rest
Will go again!
Having read the other reviews, I think most of the diners missed the boat on this, especially those looking for authentic Thai
Its not authentic because it is a Thai French fusion restaurant, a la Vong
Get with the Program
The food, service, and ambience are always great and one of the owners is ALWAYS there making sure that all of the above are consistent
The Drunken Noodles and the Seared Tuna appetizers are superb and you can't go wrong with anything else on the menu either
The only things that get pricey are the specials
Avoid those and the value is definately there
food is tasty but expensive
Pad Thai (noodles, veggies and slivers of meat) should not cost 15 dollars
enough said
Q's food is quite tasty and the ambiance cozy and warm
Love the whole red snapper and the drunken noodle
Have been twice, both times food was outstanding, haven't been disappointed
Always fresh and flavorful
Service was more than adequate, the first visit was very crowded and noisy, but then it's a small tightly set cafe
Tonight's visit it was a lot quieter, maybe because it was Sunday
Enjoyed it very much and can't wait to return
Good food, even if it's inauthentic Thai
Was there last Tues with my bf
Beef salad - a little chewy, but good
Peppercorn-encrusted tuna - wasabi dip packs a punch, despite its innocuous light green color
Chilean sea bass - highly recommended! Twister shrimp - too salty and nothing spectacular; Mango sorbet - so flavorful and rich, it tasted like ice cream! I'd go back again
I have eaten at this place a half-dozen or so times and the food has been been solid
I tried the drunken noodles last time and they were fabulous
I do agree that the menu really isn't authentic to the other Thai restaurants
This is still a good restaurant for a night out
This restaurant is pricey for the quantity but the quality is there
I went here on my birthday
The food was great and the menu is very creative
I also love the atmosphere
It was pretty expensive though
I have rather mixed feelings about this place
I love its atmosphere, even if it is small and cramped
But this Thai restaurant lacked in what I was looking for, real Thai cuisine
Their small menu consisted of neo Asian/ European influenced mess
The only authentically Thai items on the menu was the satay and Thai iced tea (which was all wrong)
I will say that the dishes were expertly prepared and presented, I just didn't know what it was they were trying to serve and trying to pass as Thai dishes
There are three other Thai restaurants in Forest Hills, all are much less expensive and will have what you want
This place is terrific
Thai or French food with French desserts
What could be a better idea!!!
I have mixed feeelings about this place, all of the dishes were not on the same par in terms of quality
Unfortunately, it is one of those fusion places that would do better if it stayed loyal to one cuisine
What I ordered was an authentically Thai dish and it was ok
I have had takeout that was better
However, my boyfriend had the softshell crab special which was amazing!! I am a big fan of softshell crabs and it would be safe to say that these were among the best I have had anywhere! Be forewarned, it is one of those hit or miss places
We were seated promptly for a Saturday lunch, but service was incredibly slow
One waitress was downright rude when we asked for the check
The food was okay, but nothing to write home about and it was not worth being treated rudely for
Skip this restaurant if you want spend a relaxing Saturday
I have gone here several times, it is absoutely romantic, weekdays are way less busy then the weekend, which is hetic!!! Generally you dont wait long for seating, the food is AMAZING, the atmosphere is classic to the cajun style
My only negative would be rarely seating on the main floor, and with a knee injury its a pain in the butt to use the stairs since the restroom are downstairs aswell
This was my fist time to Mardi Gras and I absolutely loved it! The Big Easy Platter Appitizer was the best
For dinner we had the Ribs and Filet Minon both equally amazing! For drinks we orderd the Purple Rain and Blue Hawaian
All of these were very good with the Purple Rain the best
I did not care for the Mashed Potatoes, they tasted similar to that of boxed mashed potatoes but that is my only complaint! We went late on a Friday and were seated right away
Make reservations if going earlier in the night
I was shopping a round the area and I decide to eat at mardi gras
My first impression was the live JAZZ MUSIC, the plase was nice decord, waiter are very attend, food was incredible, the food prices less than $25
00, you must try the hurricane mmm
PD: come try your self!!!
The food is excelent
The place is neat and clean
Service is impecable 100% recommended for party or groups
I was there last thursday with my friends to celebrate my birthday
All the servers and the manager brought me a yumy banana foster dessert and sang the happy birthday for me
My friends enjoyed a lot the life jazz band that was performing that night

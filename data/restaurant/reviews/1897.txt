And the service is unbearable - I waited for ages to get my drink, got the wrong sushi order, and had my appetizer whisked away prematurely
This was all after the waitress spilled a drink into my gym bag
Despite being nice about the martini-soaked gym clothes, the waitress offered my table nothing - no free round, no free dessert, and had the gall to add a 20 percent tip at the end
This place needs to learn that good service means acting responsively even when a guest has been understanding
And that being trendy doesn't make your restaurant any good
Expensive, but totally worth it
Went two nights in a row with friends from out of town
Great sake menu, but almost too tasty, watch out
If you like eel, they have a killer roll
Great longe downstairs for late night eats
Sort of hidden but well worth the investigation of finding it
We suggest sitting at the bar and having a closer look at the 6 sushi chefs there to serve you
Sushi was fresh and presented beautifully
Service was upscale but not stuck-up
Have been to resturants in DC and Boston and so far this tops the list
BondSt
is one of those places that comes along all too seldom
It combines amazing food at a valuable price and a casual chic atmosphere
Here's to BondSt!
Wow, what they say is true, we had a great time! The sushi is beyond compare for the big, well-known sushi places
The service was surprisingly NICE! We were seated immediatley and they were so accomodating
You can tell most of the staff are from the midwest, very polite and good-looking-both very important to me
Bond Street goes to show that cool and hip don't mean much when it comes to high quality food
With the exception of the excellent tempura soft-shell crab, the food was not of high quality
Sushi rolls were dry and lacking flavor, explaining the need for dipping sauces a
k
a
flavored mayonnaise
Only the yellow tail was of decent grade
Service was ok, and some reasonable wines on the list, but the check is a killer for such mediocrity
Went there last night for a fanulous birthday dinner
The fish was so fresh and the atmosphere is great
Prices are steep, but well worth it for a special occasion!
The sushi is creative and delicious, the setting is very hip, the waitresses are beautiful, but the service is surprisingly good
There are some good wine deals on the menu and a huge list of saki
I would recommend the omakase choice, but it is pricy
The lounge downstairs is also very good for people watching
better than nobu, a favorite for years, every bite is a work of art
Bond Street is so delicious
The restaurant provides a hip and fun atmosphere, but it also serves serious food
The quality is always high; the fish is so fresh and the presentation is beautifully creative
I would come here every night, if my wallet would allow
For a consistently excellent show, Bond Street is the place to go!
This is the most wonderful place to have sushi
I love the back bar, though can not stand the dining room
Even the bathroom is wonderful
I can not pass up ordering the same things every time
The duck soup and crispy shrimp rolls
I spring for the otoro (sp?) tuna and it is worth every penny
The weirdest thing is that they make the best pana cotta we have ever had--even in Italy! How weird is that? Again, RUN don't walk
i visit bond st
each year on my annual visits to the city
the best sushi i have ever had anywhere
the presentation is fabulous and the variety available is astounding
i hear the fresh fish is flown in daily from japan! amazing! don't miss the the buckwheat soba (?) risotto! (share it though
it's pretty filling)
the service was terrific and i loved the constant refilling of my water glass
i love bond street! see you this october for my visit

houston,tx
Sesame Crusted Shrimp Roll
I have dreams about it
Goat cheese crab cakes
I can't tell if the hot food is better than the sushi, but its always a quandry which to order
Pleasent staff, both in personality and in looks
Big tip: you can usually sit at the sushi bar with less than a ten minute wait
Hands down the worst dining experience that I have every had
The sushi sucks and the service is terrible
Try complaining to the manager about the horrible service and obnoxious staff and they will make you try to escort you out of the restaurant before you even get your dinner
Bottom line this place SUCKS!
In a word - loved it
I'm not a huge sushi fan, but a friend took me here on my birthday and I fell in love
The most amazing sushi I've had, although I would advise you to bring a fat wallet
Much better than Blue Ribbon in my opinion
Taste was perfect and service very friendly
Just don't be surprised when the Japanese men yell as you walk past them behind the sushi bar
As I learned, it's a Japanese custom to welcome you (albeit loud and at times distracting)
The food will keep me coming back again and again and again
Okay so the drinks are strong and the food is good but it's not good enough to compensate for the wait staffs attitude
From the moment that we were seated our waiter and service continued to get worse and worse
The only time we saw a spark in our waiters eyes was when he brought out a check for $535 (that was for five people)
I will not return to Bond Street for the simple reason of poor customer service
Too many good Sushi restaurants in the city to put up with poor attitudes at such a high cost
This is the best sushi place in NYC
The lobster roll and eel roll can't be beat
Try the Purple Dragon: a drink made with Sake and chambord
And the service is impecable
I went there for a b-day party for one of my friends
And I have to say that it was a perfect experience
Reservations are a must
The Scene The toast of many a guidebook, this Soho spot finds its unassuming storefront thronged with tourists and patient locals every evening
Inside, it's decorated fairly traditionally in bare pine, with hand-drawn signs advertising specials du jour
A good deal of the restaurant's enduring popularity is due to the casual, friendly service and mood
The Food The restaurant subscribes to the "big fish" doctrine of outsized, crowd-wowing hunks of sashimi
At restaurants serving poor fish, this trend is very tedious indeed; but here, fortunately, everything is fresh and flavorful
Slabs of yellowtail belly melt on the tongue, and a hand roll of chopped toro and scallion is richly complex
Dishes from the kitchen, such as strips of buttery squid in uni sauce, or creamy, gamy monkfish liver, excel as well
Yes, sushi was fresh and tasty
Just like in a lot more other restaurants where you don't have to wait outside for 30 minutes and then sit in a crammy tiny room
So if you want to enjoy your dinner, eat elsewhere

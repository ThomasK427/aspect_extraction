So I guess if you want a dinner of sardines and watery sangria, then Xunta is the place
I am not a picky person, and I don't mind the occasional dive experience, but Xunta was a huge disappointment - especially after reading some great reviews
The Sangria tasted like watered-down Tropicana-flavored toilet water! We couldn't even finish it
And we were so turned off by the place that we didn't even stay to try the tapas
It's loud, crowded and the service can be spotty
However, I'm a afficionado of all things New York and Xunta is consistently one of my favorites
If you are an UES snob and don't like loud, fun, places with great music that are a bit divey, then you're better off going to Industry or Butter
I really used to enjoy this place but the food has gotten progressively worse and the service really sucks
I have been there several times and they immediately tell you that all tables are reserved and you only have an hour to eat
Then when a new party comes in they actually came to our table and requested we hurry up so that these people can sit
Don't waste your time unless you sit at the bar
The bartenders are cool and provide much better service then the waitresses
I met a few friends at Xunta for a lite-dinner get-together because I had been there numerous times and loved it
This time around, the place was horrendous
One friend had to wait 45 minutes for a tapas portion of shrimp
We were unable to order any more food/drink at one point because the hostess was trying to give the table to another party and wanted us out of there
We were then given two separate bills
One written on the front, one on the back
With the one on the back including the 20% gratuity which, according to their menu, is applied only to parties of 8 of more
To add to the rudeness, the hostess told us as we were leaving that we were not welcome back
With the service we received she received no argument from us
Much better tapas places in the city for less headache
While the environment is still fun and diverse, the food quality has been sliding lately
The once great sangria has been hit or miss; ranging from brag-worthy to a sugary cool-aid mix
The cheap tabs and the friendly staff keeps me coming back
Xunta is one of the best restaurants in NYC
I've been coming here for two years, and everytime, I feel like I'm in Spain again - the tapas are excellent (and inexpensive), the sangria is strong and delicious, and the music and the crowd is international
It definitely isn't a fine dining experience, but that's the way a tapas bar is supposed to be - casual and fun
Unfortunately it gets very crowded on the weekends, so if you don't mind dining at the bar you can skip the wait for a table
This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city
The food is simple but excellent and the sangria is delicious (try the white)
It does get insanely crowded so the best time to go is rather early (before 7 PM)
You eat off barrells using lots of toothpicks so the ambiance is rather rustic, but to me that's part of the fun
If you are looking for fine dining then this is the wrong place, but if you want to have a good meal for not too much money and more sangria than you know what to do with then Xunta is an excellent bet
Reservations for 6 or more people recommended
Good date place too, if the date isn't prissy about food (I'll marry the woman who splits the grilled sardines with me)
if you want ambience
This place was a dive! I expected something more from all the applauding reviews
I was so embarrased to bring a guest from out of town here
I guess I expected more ambience
Come here to drink, but don't come here for a meal
It's not worth it
Xunta serves up excellent, authentic food at amazing prices! This is coming from a spanish girl that is used to real tapas at real Madrid bars-the patatas bravas are spot on, camarones con jamon to die for and the sangria is just right
It gets crowded towards the end of the week, so arrive early!
I went there last week with some girlfriends and we had a great time
The Sangria is VERY good, they have a wide selection of tapas and the prices are great
I wouldn't recommend wearing skirt since the tables are barrells
The service is typical spanish, they don't rush you out of there which is nice
I recommend making a reservation, would be a great place to bring a 2nd date
Xunta is a small very casual tapas bar
The ceiling is lined with fishing net and blue xmas lights
The small tables are barrels and the larger tables are picnic tables with table cloths on them
They have a large tapas menu with a good variety of items
Tried both white and red sangria which was fine but nothing special
The prices are very reasonable
The place gets very crowded
Went on a friday night w/crowd of 10 people
seating was difficult and the place was crowded
But the tapas were reasonably priced and tasted pretty good relative to other overpriced tapas bars in Manhattan
The sangrias were pretty good also and the cost was reasonable
The crowd is younger, around early 20's
Would definitely go back, but don't expect this place to be a quiet and spacious type restaurant
Service was slow too
Perhaps its less crowded during the week
The place was extremely crowded, very noisy and the interior is anything but cozy or romantic
The food was pretty bad, it loses to its competitor La Paella (just down the street) in ever aspect
The tapas were small and badly prepared
The only good aspect was the friendly service which agreed to hold a table for our large group even though everyone was at least half hour late
I occasionally get tapas in this always lively tapas bar, but much prefer La Paella up the street, which is only slightly more expensive
The quality of the tapas seems to vary wildly from day to day and isn't ever better than pretty good
I'm pretty surprised by the glowing editorial review
I've also felt really, really rushed the last few times I've been
The last time the hostess even told some folks to hover around my friend and I until we were done, and we are by no means lingerers or slow eaters
The sangria is pretty good and quite potent, though
Wednesday nights, Xunta has a great brazilian band
Very loud, but very fun
Great sangria, cheap tasty tapas
Lots of fun
Six of us went to Xunta last Friday
The tapas portions were small and the average food wasn't served timely if it was served at all
For instance, the Spicy Potatoes were merly home fries with Red Hot sauce on them
We were charged for three dishes that never came but the server did remove them from the bill
The sangria was served quickly and often
Maybe the restaurant was trying to get us too drunk to complain about the food and bill?
I don't know about you, but I personally enjoy a good sangria way more than a gin tonic (if you really need that gin tonic, Coyote Ugly is right across the street
) The sangria is great, the atmosphere is chill, and the tapas are awesome, especially the seafood and cheeses
This has become one of my favorite places to meet with friends or bring a date
Get a pitcher of red or white sangria and choose from a large selection of tapas
My personal favorites are the mixed cheeses and stuffed olives
Good selection of seafood tapas
this place was ok
No alcohol except beer wine which is fine if you drink beer and/or wine but I wanted a vodka tonic so I had to settle for beer
The food was nothing to write home about it was ok
It was so crowded I'm still trying to figure out how the wait staff made it back forth to the bar/kitchen without having someone knock into them
The Scene Tucked amid a restaurant row of sorts along West Houston Street, Yama serves up sturdy, straightforward sushi and Japanese fare
After passing a diminutive sushi bar, patrons enter a narrow, two-level dining area that sports a colorless, dated feel
Several large tables and a staff of efficient, pleasant servers make the restaurant suitable for group dining
Drink options are limited to beer, wine and sake, with small carafes of the latter costing less than $5
The Food This Yama lcoation serves up the same lengthy menu of familiar Japanese favorites that diners enjoy at the restaurant's other locations
Popular starters include overflowing bowls of edamame, lightly-fried pork dumplings and steaming bowls of miso soup

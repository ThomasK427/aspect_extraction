Nice ambience, of muted dark colors and dim lighting
Seems like if you arrive by 8:30, even on a Sat night, you won't have probs getting a table
I was dining at Kapadokya last Saturday and the food overrall was amazing
I would reccommend their fried zucchini (appetizer) and Grilled Salmon wrapped in green leaves (main entree)
The Scene  Walk into a crowded world of disco balls, trance music, mod chairs and even a swing or two
Then, discover a sea of tranquility: a pool surrounded by greenery, watched over by a golden Buddha
Downtown club meets Buddhist shrine in this large, airy space
However, the slow and sometimes rude service is more clubby than Zen
The Food Seafood is just one of the offerings on this lengthy and well-priced Thai menu
Excellent spring rolls, minty po pia sod rolls and chewy "drunk man" noodles in a fragrant brown sauce make great starts
The papaya salad is heavily dressed in vinegar, cabbage and chile oil
Fish dishes, like the whole red snapper served in a garlic-lemon sauce and marinated mummy fish, tend to be cooked to the max
Try the crispy banana with green tea ice cream for a rich, ungreasy treat, and don't miss the frisky pineapple-ginger martini
My daughter took me to this restaurant for my birthday last December
When I first walked into the place, I thought I was walking into a club
The circular bar is the first thing you see when you walk in
Then you see the pool and the tables/chairs along side it
There were a couple of swings (for one, two and/or three)
The bathrooms were too cool! (I won't describe them go there and see for yourself!) The food was one of the most delicious Thai food I've ever had
But the most impressive of all
the price! It was a steal!
Great on Parking, Fabulous view confertable and good service
It was an Impressive 1st date I must say
Loved it!!! Last but not least the food was AWESOME
I went to Sea last night for dinner with a friend
The meal was fantastic and so inexpensive
Nice vibe to the place as well
The waiter wasnt extremely attentive but not bad
I highly recommend the Water Chix - yummy!
The food was great, atmosphere is excellent and the place is nice
Crowded place, so make sure you make reservation
Anyway, the hostes is pretty good the arrange the customer
The bar is available while you waiting for the table, the DJ is nice
Excellent place
If you are looking for great food at non-NYC and non-Williamsburg prices go here
Amazing atmosphere
It does get rather loud and crouded weekend nights, but it's only because they are so awsome
Get Drunk Man's Noodles and organic ceasar salad, you'll love it!
With that said, people still love SEA and will wait gladly to sup there
SEA is the Thai TAO of Brooklyn
Ultra busy, trendy and good
It's pretty much all been said in the previous 99 reviews listed here
It's kind of too good not to talk about
Special kudos have to be given to their interior designer though besides the obvious unmistakable style of this place the furniture is particularly nice
I'm kind of surprised no one mentioned their awesome bathrooms
Certainly one of the top 5 in the city
The food is above average but not the best I've had
The atmosphere is very romantic and it is definitely worth it to take a significant other for a romantic eating by the centerpiece
You are sure to leave with your wallet nice and fat
I've only been here once, and I would go more often if this restaurant was closer to me
I absolutely loved the atmosphere; it was full of life with beautiful decor
Since we got there early, my friends and I didn't make any reservations, and we were seated promptly
The servers were very polite and very attentive to our needs
We ordered a lot of food, and everything was delicious, with one exception - their duck
However, everything else was fantastic! Not to mention their prices! This place is definitely worth the trip
The bar is crowded but the mojitos are unbelievable, the food is amazing and cheap and the music, sometimes too loud, is awesome
This is the place to go when you want to go away from the overrated manhattan trendy and supposely good restaurants
Bring a date and seat by the pool
handle the rest
Half a block is a very nice lounge on Bedford btw N5th and 6th
Can't go wrong here with the appetizer menu- the sa-taes are excellent as well as the spring rolls with taramind sauce
I've had the massaman curry with chicken (chicken was too dry) and with tofu which I liked a lot more than chicken (absorbed the sauce better)
Drunken noodles are excellent, but skip the Sea duck - it was awful
Too sweet and saucy, the duck itself was dry and flavorless
I loved this place so much
My fiance took me there on my birthday on a Wednesday night
The atmosphere was great
Service and food, perfect
The decor is so beautiful
It is very romantic, especially if you sit on the two person tables by the budhas
I would definitely go there again
This place had a great combination between, decor, ambiance,great food and service
I just enjoyed it to the max and will definitely go there many times more
I had to wait 1hr since I got there around 8pm but you could have a few drinks by the bar since the ambiance is very loungy/ club like
Its not loud so you could still have conversations
Great for bday parties, food was just great and the prices? well you just dont see it ofter $4 for appetizers and $9-16 for a main course? just great
The service, my water glass was never empty, I was very well attended but not overly to the point that you feel of being kicked out
I lasted over 2 hours dinning and drinking and not once was I rushed
Anyhow, overall this restaurant just became one of my favorites!
One of my favorites
It's not a 5 star place or anything, but what's not to love
Wonderful decor, delicious thai food, cheap cheap prices! Good drinks (usually), the service is lacking and there are usually long waits on the weekends
Great place to take out of towners
The food at Sea is below avg and overpriced for what you get
(Those that have been to Planet Thai will understand that if you go
) And don't forget the svc, those waiters stare at you your entire meal, just waiting for you to put your fork down and they snatch the plate away in a second
They hover over you so AS SOON as you have taken that last bite or sip of a drink, they want you out so they can get more business in
Makes you very uncomfortable and not want to come back
However, having said that, the drinks at SEA are fabulous and worth every cent! The bartenders are not stingy w/the liquor! And the atmosphere/ambience of this place is fantastic
I recommend going for a drink and eating somewhere else
Went there this past Saturday for a bday party and it was an excellent venue
This place is really good for large groups
They have a DJ playing good house music
Very trendy
The ambience and the decor is fabulous and the food was really good
The only prob was that it was very, very, very crowded at the entrance and bar area
It was literally like sardines in a can
I wondered if having that area so crowded was a fire hazard
Apart from that, make a reservation and enjoy
This is a place I wouldn't mind visiting again, its worth it

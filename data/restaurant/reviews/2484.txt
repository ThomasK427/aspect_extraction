The food was really good, especially if you're in the mood for an elegant sea food dinner
My food was excellent but my dates was a little cold
I think his dish was waiting in the window for mine for a while
I would still highly recommend the restaurant, it was an excellent evening
Food was excellent
Our fish was very fresh and flavorful
The jumbo shrimp cocktail was very good, but I wish I would have gotten the raw bar sampler I saw on other tables
Lesson learned for next time (and there definitely will be a next time)
Service was excellent
Tables were crowded together
I ate here this past weekend, it is one of my new favorite restaurants
I had the lobster and shrimp cocktail, the salmon along with the sweet potato fries, plus dessert
I couldn't help myself it was wonderful
Went thursday (labor day weekend) I had the striped bass, husband had the swordfish
Both were tasty, and the spinach gnocchi with the sauces and veges was great! Service was average, not bad but not spectacular
The place was hopping by 8:30
I would recommend it
There are decent selections if you are a seafood person, but not a lot if you aren't! Portions are average, not huge, and the rolls are chewey but good!
I'm not much of a fish eater, but the dishes here were delicious--not to mention beautiful
Additionally the server was more than happy to offer her opinion and suggestions as to what my friend and I might enjoy
The portions were the perfect size for me--not too big and definitely not too small
An excellent overall experience
Went to the Ocean Grill after visiting the Museum in th afternoon
We were seated outside, and it was a great atmosphere for a nice dinner
Our server was knowledgeable ane very pleasent
The only downfall was that our appetizer never showed up, we were apologized to, and it wasn't on our bill, but we also didn't get the jumbo shrimp we were all craving
The food itself was good
We had Atlantic Salmon, Maryland Crabcakes, and Yellow Finned Tuna
They all appeared on rather similar looking dishes, but all tasted quite good
The wine selection and deserts were also very good
nice corner place with med
flavours and cute waitresses
I will go back for the atmosphere
My wife and I happened upon this local eatery when we first moved to NYC
It's been one or our favorite restaurants ever since
Great food, very attentive and pleasant staff - and pleasant atmosphere make this an enjoyable haunt for a nice brunch, an afternoon of cocktails or a romantic dinner
Highly recommend the hummus starter with moracan cigars (goat cheese rolled in crushed pine nuts wrapped in roasted eggplant)
Then a saba salad (apple, walnuts, cranberries, zesty honey dressing)
Staff is great and if you go more than 1-2 a month they will remember you like an old friend
It's been a while, but I strongly recommend the restaurant for its tasty brunches
Though I already knew the place, when my date took me there it was casual enough but tasty with its upper west side ny atmosphere
Was looking for a photo, and this link came up in google so decided to write a view
The brunch and a short walk was definitely a plus but not too made up for his smoothness
i love monaco,for it's food,and friendly stuff,i love humus with mushrooms,frute de mari with seefood!!!love the musik and atmosphere
!!!!!
I absolutely love this place
In the past couple months I've been there about ten times
The restaurant has a great feel to it, and the food is delicious
My husband always gets the chicken tajine (sp?) which is amazing
I mix it up a little more
I've a couple of their chicken dishes, one of their lamb dishes, and a couple of their pastas
Everything I've had was great (though the lamb couscous could've been better)
The service is just as good as the food
I highly recommend this place
I've been to Monaco a couple of times
The first time, I was blown away by the Chicken Penne pasta and the fresh home-made bread thats served before the orders come
I was craving for the Chicken Penne for a long time after that, and so I went and ordered it for lunch, but the chicken was not fresh and the bread was tough too
I went back for the third time and although the bread wasn't as fresh as the first time I had it, the Chicken Penne was back to its original quality
I highly recommend their prix-fixe menu srevd 'til 7PM everyday ($18
95)
The service was awesome and the music was good too
I could keep on coming back for more!
There are a lot of restaurants on the UWS that look like Monaco, so it took us a while to eat there
I wish we'd tried it sooner
We started with brunch- great omlets, and we split a bowl of potato-leek soup
Last night we went for dinner with a friend, brought the dog, and sat on the patio
My girlfriend and I split the black linguini, which was unusually prepared and delicious
The service was exceptional on both of our visits
Even the dog enjoyed it
This is a great neighborhood restaurant
We were walking on the UWS tonight and stumbled into this place
What a pleasure
We were promptly seated outside and from the minute we stepped in, the waitstaff was wonderful
I found the meals to be priced fairly and the quality was good
2 meals, 2 drinks and an appetizer was $71
00 with tip which isn't too bad
Nice, simple decor, nice-looking waitstaff and bartender, large menu with Mediterranean and Italian fare
Around five vegetarian items on menu
Food was inoffensive, somewhat bland
House red wine was too sweet
Prices were steep, entrees $12-$20
Good local place to meet with a small group of friends, but don't go out of your way or try to impress a date here
Was walking around the area looking for a place to eat with my boyfriend early afternoon on Sunday
We just happened to find this place and it was great
Outside seating is nice, service is great, prices are very reasonable for quality of food and the food is fresh and well prepared
We could have stayed there all day kicking back and enjoying the rays ( and their yummy mimosas! )
Monaco is a charming restaurant on Amsterdam Ave's restaurant row with outdoor seating during good weather
The brunch is tasty and worthwhile though not particularly unique
The brunch menu is not like their regular menu which has mediterranean flare
Service during either brunch or dinner could be quicker and more attentive at times
THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL BRUNCH AND WELL-PRICED DRINKS
I HAVE MADE THIS A NEW COMMANDMENT FOR GOOD SERVICE, DELICIOUS FOOD, AFFORDABLE PRICES AND OUTDOOR SEATING
MY BEST SUGGESTION IS TO BE THERE FOR THEIR WEEKEND BRUNCH
YOU WON'T REGRET IT! ALSO, THE DINNER MENU IS NOT BAD
The Scene This chain of upscale diners seems to have discovered the formula for success: big helpings of American comfort food at reasonable prices in bright and friendly surroundings
Families flock to EJ's, and a small sign in the entryway asking parents to fold strollers make it clear just how much of a presence kids are
The interior is like a Rockwell painting, with classic blue-and-white diner decor and an old-fashioned lunch counter
The Food The highlight here, believe it or not, is the cereal: huge, crunchy portions of oatmeal and granola with a generous sprinkling of fresh fruit and berries
The almond- and corn-flake-encrusted French toast is another favorite
Typical diner food makes up most of the rest of the menu--burgers, chili, Buffalo wings and the like, along with peanut butter and jelly and hot dogs for the kids

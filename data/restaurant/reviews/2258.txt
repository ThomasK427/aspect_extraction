Might be a little more than you're willing to spend, but
can't complain
Just the tonic after a week's worth of stale Dunkin' Donuts
Norma's what more can I say it serves the best Breakfast
I love the fact it is open untill 3pm they serve the best pancakes in Town!!!!
The menu here is fun and has wide selections for brunch
I've tried a couple times here but each time I came the food was just ok
The wait is quite long, about 30min to 1 hr on a weekend
I don't think I'll go again (after going 3-4 times already) because nothing really tasted great
I kept going back to see what's so great about it, but didn't find it
Their fresh squeezed orange juice was good though
I tried pancakes with banana and chocolate, Juevos Rancheros, etc
Nothing stood out!! In fact I think the Juevos Rancheros was not good at all
memorable coffee
fresh juice
delicious smoothy
unique frittata
nutty toast
fruit spread was an incredibly pleasant surprise
This will be my place for breakfast from now on
Oh! you do pay for this level of quality
I have gone there a few times
The food is always fresh and innovative, but will still satisfy your need for familarity--if in that mood
The menu is varied enough that everyone can find something special
The staff is very welcoming
They make every guest feel special
This place is excellent for Saturday and Sunday brunch! Beware though, the wae wait time after 11:00 am is horrific! We waited for and hour an a half for two people
When we were seated, they told us that they don't serve alcohol anymore
There went our typical Sunday brunch with a refreshing mimosa
We stayed in the Parker Meridien so Norma's was an obvious choice for breakfast our first morning in Manhattan
Other than the wait being long the food and service were both excellent
Great coffee!
My fiance' and I were guest at the La Parker Meridian for a week back in June of 2001, We enjoyed Norma's so much that we ate there every morning
I have to say that the breakfast at Norma's is simply the best I have ever eaten
The staff was wonderful and the service fantastic! It is definately a place I will frequent when in New York, which is my favorite place in the world I might add
Although I enjoyed all the entree's, I believe the Crepes with Black Forest Ham and Bree' was my favorite
Tommy and Rosie Politz Baton Rouge , LA
I went to Norma's with two friends and all of us were pleased
Although I expected the food to be a little better, I'll probably go back to give it a second try
The menu is huge and there are plenty of things to choose from
I had the egg quesadilla and biscuits
The biscuits were not hot and they were a little soggy and my egg dish was a little bland
My friends both had the egg fritatta and they loved it
The portions are huge and there is a lot of hype about this being the best brunch place
I was disappointed, but I'll go back b/c I have heard so many good things
Nothing beats this place for overall quality and quantity of amazing breakfast food
Where else can you get 5 types of eggs, 3 types of french toast, multiple waffles, krispy kreme doughnuts (heated up if you ask), and anything else you could possibly want for breakfast
A must do for breakfast
Their Chocalate Decadence is to die for
The tasty little smoothies that precede the meal are fabulous
I am always satisfied after a visit to Norma's
My husband and I both thought Norma's was very overrated
We waited close to two hours, and the menu items were all too sweet and rich
We weren't impressed, and will not return
Fabulous!!! Everything good that everyone had said up till now is true - and more
The only drawback was how tough it was to choose!!! I actually didn't find the decor cold and intimidating, or the prices too high! My Mom and I split the scrambled egg Salmon stuffed croissant - amazing
Each half portion could have been a whole in any other restaurant
In addition, Kimberly, the sweetest waitress ever, let us order half an order of pancakes - which was huge anyway
We were full, not stuffed and comletely satisfied by every bite
With that, coffee and tip, we were out $45 - and did not need to eat again till late afternoon
You owe it to yourself to indulge
very creative, fun-good for group, food is great, must go early though as gets crowded on weekends-but a great special occasion place
We went on a Friday morning around 9:00, we had to wait about 10 minutes, no problem
Decor was very modern, very cool
The OJ was awesome, Banana nut pancakes were the best we've ever had, and the Chocolate French Toast was unbelievable
The cost was $60 with tip for 2 people
Expensive yes, but in NYC it's not overly expensive
I didn't eat the rest of the day and I could only finish 2/3 of the French Toast
The coffee was European in flavor, very good
I can't wait to go back!!
Undoubtably, the best brunch I have had anywhere in the city
We were seated when they told us we would be and every dish was delicious
The waiter was friendly and even the maitre'd helped us with our decisions
French toast, omelettes anything your heart desires
No wonder everyones plate was clean
the food was to good to resist
It was worth the hour wait and I can't wait to go back again!
Feels very posh and trendy - the food was delicious, although the seating was a bit cramped
Went for a Sat
brunch
The sample smoothie was the best I've ever had
Didn't order it though
The food was good overall, but unremarkable given the price
Great OJ
Overcooked eggss
Nice neat restaurant layout
70 bucks including tip for 2
oj (very good) carrot juice (gritty pulp!), one coffee (above avg), waffle dish eggs benedict
eggs were cold
english muffin tough as nails
home fries were bland not the least bit warm
waffle (wazaa) was tasty
service was friendly but overwhelmed, even after peak time
i can't say that it would be worth a second trip anytime soon
shoulda mentioned the cold dish to someone
I took my friend here for a birthday brunch and we both agreed that Norma's is fabulous! The only downside to this place is the wait; even with a reservation we waited almost an hour for our table! However, once you gain your entry pass, you'll find the food to be simply divine and worth the few extra $
Not to mention you might spot a celebrity or politician in there
Governor Pataki sat right next to us
My husband and I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere
Wait staff friendly and attentive but not overbearing

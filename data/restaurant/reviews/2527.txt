People-down to earth and very nice
i'll be back there this wkend
The back garden makes you feel like you're somewhere else
The food is delicious and well priced
Added BONUS, great DJs for late evening cocktailing and mingling
Owners are there everynight and everybody knows your name eventually because you'll be back
Ciao Vespa!
Surprisingly great for a cool, and funky non-typical Italian restaurant
Definately a more downtown spot, than an upper-east side place
One of the most interesting wine list and very reasonably priced
Most bottles between $26 $38 and they even have a selection of 'organically grown wines'
Fresh Pastas are not to be missed, we sampled Gnocchi(light as a feather) Pappardelle with truffles
Servers were very knowledgeble about the food, and very accomodating
Definatley worth going back, especially when they get their garden open
I had my birthday on February the 25th (party of five) and i was surprised by the courtesy of the staff and the atmosphere at the restaurant, food was delicious (by the way i'm italian) and i found a very good variety of red wines
If you are looking for fun and good food at reasonable prices Vespa Restaurant is the spot
i recently had the honer of eating at vespa and i would love to tell you about the experiance from the moment i walk in to the time i walk out of this beautiful place it was nothing but smiles
both of my face and the staff
the food was way past great and the service and the music was even better
what can i say about the food?it was like my grandmother was bought back from the dead and cooked me my favorite meal!! enjoy!!!!
Great atmoshpere
All the food was well seasoned, nice flavors
A better wine list than most places on the upper east side
Every neighborhood should have a place this good
I have found my new spot on the upper east side
The perfect place dinner with a date, or anyone else for that matter
You truly feel comfortable and at home at this hip italian hot spot
The rabbit is amazing!
the place is a nice change from the typical UES eatery
A bit pricey however for semi-satisfactory cuisine
The garden is beautiful, and the staff is very polite
A good place to take a nice long dinner, but not if you are pinching pennies, or in the mood for exceptional food
Oh and if you aren't a fan of cher and annoying house music then avoid going any time there is a DJ!
A beautiful space, the outdoor garden is lovely, the food was superb and the service was impeccable
The tasting plate appetizer was a terrific value - big enough to share with the entire table
I went to this Upper East side restaurant on Labor day for dinner
This restaurant matched up to the hype
The food was excellent and the service was impeccable
Myself and my guest were treated like members of the aristocracy
The only bad thing I could about this restaurant is the menu was a little limited
Also on the patio they only played George Michael Music, weird for an Italian restaurant
This is a great restaurant for a first date
Bottom Line, go to Vespa
The outdoor seating at Vespa is only outdone by the food! The wine suggestions given to us produced some of the best I've ever had
(Don't forget to try the dessert wines, too!) Everytime I come here I like what I've ordered more and more, and even though I live downtown, I look for excuses to head up to eat here
By far, one of my favorite places in the city
Visiting from Italy I had to try out Vespa after overhearing some New Yorkers talk about it here in Rome
It was fantastic
An outdoor garden that was only missing the view of the Coloseum
Grazie per le servizio e tutti le cibo buono
Buona Fortuna a tutti le ragazze a Vespa! Bravissimo!!!!!!!!!
Went to Vespa Saturday night with some friends and had a fabulous time
My girlfiend's co-worker brought us there and it was a nice surprise, food was very good, casual comfortable atmosphere, back patio where you can smoke for all you smokers! I don't go uptown that much, usually stay mid-town or go to Little Italy for Italian, but I will certainly be coming back here again
The new owner's were there and they were great! It was a pleasure to meet them and see them in the front of the house being involved with everything
Great place to go with friends for a casual evening with awesome food!
After reading all the good reviews on citysearch, I have to say, I don't really know what all the fuss is about
Maybe the dish I ordered wasn't that great
But in all fairness, my friends that i went with LOVED their dishes (salmon and chicken)
I thought my dish (shells w/sausage) was average tasting
Definitely homemade, but nothing spectacular, especially for the price ($18-30)
It's also a small restaurant so the space felt pretty tight, but to their credit, the place was packed
It has a cozy neighborhood feel and is more of a casual-night-out-with-friends kind of place than a make-a-great-impression kind of place
In my opinion, it wasn't really worth the price, but again, my friends disagreed
imagine driving through the italian countryside just breezing along on your vespa and you are stopped by a cavalcade of celebrities
WEll what to do? take chicky pics and plaster them on your wall back in nyc
Now you you got the food, ambieance and the decor that brings me back to the time i was just cruizing along and snapping pictures
Nicely Done Guys
If St
Peter could speak, he would say, Take me to Vespa
This is an open-late, friendly with an extra e establishment, and run by two guys who will treat you like a Duke, or maybe even a young prince with newly acquired lands
Imagine Fellini, Godard and a Spanish prostitute having a group child and you have a wonderful sense of the sleek and fun decor
For bonuses: arrive on a Vespa
I am a downtown girl living in an uptown world, with Vespa I need look no further
The vibe is there friends! Wonderful food, fabulous patrons, great music, a staff of angels and the ownwers, too cool for school
Vespa is much more than a neiborhood place, it a reason to come to the Upper East Side
How many times do you go to a restaurant once, think it is the greatest, the best, really cool and rave toyour friends who go and can't understand why you said what you did? Consistency is the key
I have been to Vespa over the course of the past 2 years a dozen times
I have never failed to be warmly greeted, as are the people in front of me and those who come after
The service is always courteous, correct and attentive
The food
Well, the food: there is always something different on the menu
There is always a new pairing of ingredients
The dishes have always sung, some louder, some more quietly, but they have always performed
I have never left dissatisfied
And vis a vis price/quality: never have I felt ripped off
I have always felt that the price was fair, and the quality was well above average
Where wine is concerned, this is really a great place to drink! Try the different wines, not your usual pinot grigio
Ask the owner to recommend something
I've never been dissapointed when I've done that
The garden always looks inviting, but I love the cool provided by the A/C
My experiences dining at Vespa have been among the very best in NYC
The food is magnificent-- for starters, the mozzarella- flown from Italy- is the freshest I've had-- and the pasta and fish are amazing
Perhaps most impressive, however, is the quality of the staff, all of whom go out of their way to make customers feel comfortable and special in this cozy, hip spot
I Highly recommend Vespa
Vespa is an awesome place for dinner or just to hang out
There are always groups of friends in there having a great time
The gnochi melts in your mouth
The owners are very friendly, they want to know your name and make you feel comfortable
Definitely makes you want to come back to support these guys
The food and service is awesome and the friendly ambience makes you want to be a regular

when u eat they play the jazz music whaooo is like cafe or lauoge
they have nice sheet in tatami is like vvip class when you watch the tv
thats the last time i eat in daruma n never eat again in daruma until now
next time i must back to eat n watch my littel angel angelina
I had the best Japanese food at Daruma last night
The uni was so fresh and the mango/salmon roll was so good and refreshing
The server we had(i think her name was kelly) was super nice
I would recommend this place if you like good Japanese good
Public, to thee I pledge eternal love
You are the coolest restaurant I know, with the most impressive ambience, the best martinis, the most fantastic scallops and Hokey Pokey ice cream, and the even more delicious bartenders
I love you for brunch, I adore you for dinner, I swoon for you over late-night cocktails
Even my Mom loves you! Dear Public, keep feeding me that crazy fusion food, and my devotion for you will never die
The bartender made bloody marys with a smile, a smile that quickly turned to shock when he saw that the hostess failed to seat usagainat a newly cleared table
We had been waiting to sit for over an hour
The three hostesses at the front cant handle the handfull of customers that come in for Sunday brunch
As the hostesses walked around with their noses in the air (literally) and their chests pushed out, all three failed to 1)smile, 2)speak to us without sounding like a valley girl and 3) tell us the truth
We watched them repeatedly sit parties before us that clearly showed up long after us and were told they arrived first
The mediocre food is not worth the hideous treatment we received
The only person more shockingly rude than the hostesses was the restaurants manager
Too bad Public isnt welcoming to theirs
One of our favorite sushi hole in the walls
there are seriously like 3 tables here and a tiny sushi bar
That being said, the dcor is bright and clean, and the sushi is consistently very fresh tasting sushi dinner deluxe is a great assortment of seafood that does not include the much-maligned uni or ika (no offense to fans of those you are a special minority as you know)
It would be a crime not to pair the sushi dinner with a few pots of hot sake and a few large n sturdy cans of ice cold Sapporo beer
What makes Quan a repeater for us is that they neither overcharge for the fish nor the drinks
so eat fish, and drink up! Kampai !!
$6
25 bento or sushi lunch special
Large portions
I had sashimi lunch $8
25 - about 12 large pieces of fish w/ rice on the side
Cute place, very clean
I love Cafe 7
Its a great place to hang out
Everyone there is so laid back
I love it because the waiters are always there to attend you, you dont have to wait around forever to get someones attention
Great place to hang!!!
individual diners can order a plate of rice with one entre for $3
50
large groups can get a variety of filling flavourful dishes like congee, roasted meats on rice, noodles (fried or in soup), and rice casseroles
the food is very similar to what you get at fast food restaurants in hong kong
the cooks can be overzealous with the oil, but to me, thats part of the charm
menu is bilingual and extensive so theres something for everyone
service is efficient, though not always courteous
i recommend the chicken mushroom rice casserole (served in a clay pot so that the rice on the edges is toasted crispy), fried salt and pepper squid, and fried rice noodles with beef
prices range from $3
50 - $7 per dish (average casserole around $5) afterwards, im always stuffed, but my wallet never has to take a beating
but only if you know what to order
This hidden little restaurant is a bit more modern than the Cantonese restaurants that have and always will have the same po-po's coming to chat with their girlfriends
Yummy's specialties are the congee (jook) and the casseroles that come in the clay pots
The casseroles are great, full of chicken or veggies and rice that's soft on top but cripier as you hit the bottom
Definitely don't try to eat a whole casserole on your own though! Curry is good too and the wonton noodle soup is up to par
For dessert, definitely have the taro tapioca soup- hot or cold- as a great way to finish off
Menus and waiters are both available in english
Great Food, Great Service, Nice location, and beautiful restaurant! What can I say, but say go and have a wonderful experience! The brick oven gices the restaurant a welcoming and cozy feeling
Small place, but very romantic if you need it to be, and great for groups
The wait staff are friendly, and the food is out of this world
Definitely a must go! The bar is also nice and drinks are very good
Won't leave a hole in your pocket
This place has very good coffee, bagels and cakes
Unfortunately the service is terrible especially on weekends
Longs lines are one thing and could be bearable if the staff were more hospitable, got the order right occasionally and didn't spend most of their time chatting with their buddies in front or behind of the counter
The staff aren't very professional e
g
they tend to serve their friends and let them cut in line, further contributing to long waits for paying customers
Despite the good coffee after so many maddening visits we've sworn to never go back
The coffee is very good, and the pastries are much better than Starbucks (not hard to do), but the real star of this place is the cappucino
They get the milk just right, and it's delicious
Staff is usually friendly, and it has a nice ambience
it's amazing! This coffee is truly a work of art
The owner, who has invested his entire life into this place, has invested wisely
Everything from the staff, the music, the pastries, and most importantly the jo, is superb
This is a place not to be missed by coffee fans, and those who have yet to become caffeine (or decaf) fanatics
The burgers at Zaitzeff are mouthwatering! I have never had a better burger
Lunchtime during the week is very busy, so be prepared to wait a while for your lunch, but it's well worth it! They might seem a touch expensive, but they are made of all organic ingredients, and you can taste the difference
ive ordered from here through seamless web twice already and they have some of the best burgers in the city
the kobe beef burger (quarter-pounder $8
25, half-pounder $15
25) is juicy and cooked exactly to your specifications
they claim to use only organic ingredients (not that i care)
the lettuce, tomatoes, and grilled onions are all very fresh good garnishes definitely make a difference! they also serve fresh gourmet mustard (very good)
the zaitzeff burger ($8
25) is good, but the meatloaf patty tends to fall apart during consumption so it can get a bit messy
as an added perk, the burgers come on portuguese muffins (similar to english muffins)
fries ($4
50) come in either sweet potato or regular russet form get the regular as the sweet version is soggy
the regular fries are thin, lightly-seasoned, and freshly cut with skin on
menu is limited but whats there is good
I've never been to the restaurant (just delivery through Seamless Web) but it has become my go-to place for salads
I recommend adding the sweet potato/cheddar/avocado to the mixed green salad for a delicious, healthy meal
I don't know of any other restaurant that puts as many different kinds of fresh greens and herbs in their salads, which is what I love about Zaitzeff's
The organic chicken sandwich and the veggie sandwich are also quite good, and the sweet potato fries are great
It's a limited menu, but I've enjoyed everything I've tried
this place is the best
A 10! They get their kobe straight from the farm
I absolutely adore this place for burgers and pretty much won't have one anywhere else
Kobi beef burger or just their organic sirloin burgers are really juicy and full of flavor
The toppings such as tomatoe and lettuce are always ripe and tasty
The portugese muffin they use as the roll is delicious
When I worked in the financial district, this place was a amazing treat

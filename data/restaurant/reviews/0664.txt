I go out often since I am in the industry
And it's been a long time since I've had food that was so memorable (had the roasted red snapper)
The place oozes romance - but not in that couples only romantic way
The only downside was the reservation hostess who wasn't overly friendly
But I never got to see her anyway
Salt was such a pleasant surprise
The restaurant is dimly lit with candles and is very cozy and romantic
The menu is pretty limited, but the food is absolutely delicious
For an appetizer, I highly recommend the honey-glazed dates wrapped in bacon
yummy
They also have a great wine selection
Definitely a great place to bring a date
My girlfriend and I went to salt this week for the first time, and it was great! The food was awesome but really I was totally impressed by the service
Alot of times when you go to a small restaurant like this the staff can be very indifferent, but not here
Its seemed like every person who helped us was actually happy to do so
The manager even came over and helped us choose a bottle of wine that was amazing! We had everything the waitress recommended and she was right on! The eggplant, the rissotto, the dorade, and the steak were all delicious
Good job guys
My advice to everyone else
put yourself in their hands when you go here, they won't steer you wrong
That's right for anyone who lives in the neighborhood, you would have never thought it, but romance exhists in a restaurant on Macdougal street just south of Houstan
I brought a date here earlier this week and had one of those meals you don't soon forget
A beautifully lit room that wasn't too quiet (sometimes that can be creepy) a great bottle of champagne, the food was so tasty! I ordered the steak and my date ordered the dorade fish and they were both great
Pastis has nothing on this steak it was very flavorfull and tender
Everyone else seems to be listing what they like about a place so I'll do the same
ROMANTIC, great fish, steak, risotto, chicken liver mouse
Anyone looking for a Valentine's Day spot, I highly recomend it
Had appetizers at Salt in November 2005 and enjoyed the cauliflower soup, risotto, dates, and roasted eggplant
It was a quiet night, so we didn't experience the harried service and crowding
Returned on January 20, 2006 and were quite disappointed
The risotto and dates were still good, but the entrees were all mediocre: venison (flavorless and overcooked, despite requesting medium-rare), salmon (dry and overcooked), and tagliatelle
Service abrupt, bordering on rude
Ambience uncomfortably crammed; we were jostled and elbowed by passersby and neighbors throughout the course of our meal
Overall: Salt is not worhwhile
There are many better options at this price, with consistent food, pleasant service, and comfortable surroundings
Wow my friends are regulars at this place and they took me there Saturday
One word DATES
They have these dates wrapped in bacon they were amazing! My friends made me try them and I'm glad they did it's now my favorite snack in the entire city
But the whole experience was alot of fun
We didn't have a reservation but we had a glass of wine at the bar while we waited and met some cool people and they got us a table even though it was busy, SCORE! Totally worth the wait
all the other food was great too and service was quick and friendly but those dates were awesome!
We had a 9 PM reservation, and when we arrived, we were told it would be a few minutes wait
Minutes turned into an hour-long wait with non-existent standing room
Manager tried to ignore this fact and was very rude and unapologetic when we complained
Also, whoever said the place was romantic was quite a kidder
The entire restaurant is one very crammed room where you have to move your table so people at the table next to you can get in and out
The food was decent, but at these prices, there are tons of better options in New York
Management must be making a killing from packing in and over-booking tables at the expense of class and quality of service
Well I don't actually live too close to this restaurant, but when I went there they treated me like I was one of their regular neighborhood clientele
I'm a picky eater but the food was sooooo good! Wine was great my server Amy was very friendly
Got our steaks quick (one of the best I've had in a while) and desert was awesome pecan pie! They even sent us little dates for free
Over all it was the best place my friends and I have been to in a while though we live on the upper west side this is definately my new neighborhood restaurant
I love it!
Had some friends in from out of town and went here after reading previous reviews
Made a reservation for 7:00 p
m
for four through an online service
When we got there the host insisted that we had made a reservation for three
When I insisted we need seating for four he then said we were going to mess up his planned seating arrangement and that he really knew how to seat a room
I later went back and checked my reservation, it was for four! Very rude
He did finally seat us for four by the freezing cold door while patrons walked in and out
He also told us before we sat down that he might have to ask us to leave if we took up too much time at the table
The food was actually good, but the poor service just ruined the meal
Great food, quaint restuarant, and great out of the way neighborhood to walk around and explore
Higly recommended
This place was great, that classic small quaint tight SoHo restaurant
Wait staff was very cool friendly the ambience was phenomenal
It had the makings of a great place, until I got my entree which was horrible
almost repugnant
I got the pasta with sausage, onions etc
It was quite hard to eat, the combination of flavors gelled in no way shape or form in my mouth
So maybe I'm naive to the latest trends in dining, but I really didn't like it
Funny thing is my wife loved her food, thought it was some of the best she had had in a while
I guess I just ordered the wrong thing
I found this place through the Diner's Deck, my new favorite dining guide for New York City
I had a fantastic meal and plan to bring my friends who are coming in from out of town here
I heard about the cauliflower soup and although I'm not a big cauliflower fan, decided to give it a try
It was absolutely amazing! Very creamy (but not heavy) and smooth with a fabulous flavor, accented with truffles
The diver scallops (special of the day) wrapped with bacon and served with pureed potatoes was equally magnificent, offering a lively combination of tastes and textures
The chocolate cake was rich, moist and decadent, and the ever-so-slightly-tart olive oil ice cream served with it was a thoughtful and well-balanced pairing
The chef, Melissa, is truly magnificent! The communal tables, exposed brick walls and glittering string lights accenting the ceiling made for a cozy environment; and for those who want a little more privacy (as did Angie Everhart the night I was there), the front window tables offer a romantic retreat
Service was very attentive without being intrusive
A+
Well maybe it was her first night, I dunno
But a server coming up to the table chewing gum while she went through the specials is not my idea of professional
Sure it's a laid back place but come on - to boot the service was slow and they flip-flopped servers on us a couple of times
Besides that the food was very good (not spectacular - I had the Brook Trout) and the space is very cute (but a bit loud - even for a Thursday) I'd go back if invited but would not make plans there again
This small restaurant delivers tasty food in a relaxed and comfortable environment
Service is great and the open windows make summer dining inside more pleasurable
Salt was wonderful
Although all the starters sounded appealing, I followed Citysearch's advice and had the cauliflower soup with truffle oil
I'm glad I did--it was truly delicious! My main course, an interesting pasta dish with a very flavorful sauce of duck, garlic, onions, walnuts and various spices, was original and altogether enjoyable
My side of eggplant grilled with garlic was also very tasty, although a little SALTy, as were the braised leeks
My friend's lamb shank was pleasantly spicy and rather heavenly
While the restaurant was not crowded, the atmosphere was lively
Our waitress was most gracious, providing attentive service, while still leaving us adequately alone to chat up a storm
In fact she let us sit and sip for hours without any pressure at all
Salt was the perfect place for a great girl's night out
And would be for a date as well
After losing our reservations the hostess/owner had the nerve to be unapologetic about it and then was rude when we asked when we would be able to be seated
We waited at the bar and was served wine that had turned

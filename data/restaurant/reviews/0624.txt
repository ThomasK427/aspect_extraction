Try the duck and the sole, and an espresso martini for dessert
My brother is visiting from Chicago, and last week I gave him a tour of New York City
After taking a walk through Central Park we spent the afternoon at Nice Matin on W 79th Street
Wow!   This is the neighborhood restaurant I have been looking for - except that I live in Brooklyn
If I lived on the U West side, I would be a regular!   The food was great (Lamb Ravioli, 5-Napkin Burger), so was the service
We loved the Blood Orange Martini
My brother said: I wish we had restaurants like this in Chicago!
I only come to NY during fashion week every year
one of the best parts of my trip is eating at the great restaurants the city offers
unfortunatly, I wasted my time hear
I fallowed the recommendation of an old friend that just didn't pan out
I waited to long for my table and then waited to long for my food
When it finaly came, it turned out to be just OK for NY standereds
There are so many new great places I think this place has got to work alittle harder at making there guests happy
I had eaten here once when it opened, only to find that it needed a little time to work out it's problems
After reading some of these wonderful reveiws on city search, I returned
Much to my dismay they still had problems with the timing of the food and the heating of the food
The biggest thing that bothers me besides the food was that this restaurant has a harder working publicist than it's CHEF
This place is wonderful
I entertain clients all the time and had the best experience last night
I had a slight wait time but Sandy, the Maitre D' was very accomodating , even when i asked him to can we fake my drink because i am pregnant
so that I could surprise the guests I was dining with
Everything was an absolute delight from the start to finish
I live on the east side where everything closes a 9pm, but will trek over the park again and again - thank to all the staff for making it a great experience
I have eaten here twice and the only thing redeaming about this restaurant is it's hamburger and the fact that it is easy to get a table
Me and my friends were surprised to find that all the other food on the menu was sudo FRENCH and not so good at that
The burger how ever was good but not great
For the price I was expecting alot better and probobly could have got it down the street for less
GOOD LUCK
The place is nice, service is nicer
You should check out the hostess, Red
She brightens the place with her smile
Food is great
I'M NOT ONE TO USUALLY POST REVIEWS BUT, WHAT A TREAT TO VISIT A FRIEND ON THE UWS AND FIND THIS GEM OF A PLACE WHEN THE REST OF THE AREA WAS DEAD! FRIENDLY STAFF AND AMAZINGLY DELISH FOOD
I TRAVEL TO NICE OFTEN SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND THIS PLACE DOES IT JUSTICE
IT'S ALSO FUN TO SEE A DAYTIME SOAP STAR, TALK SHOW HOST OR ANCHORPERSON TOO
MY FRIEND HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET BE UP THERE AND I AM GLAD I MADE THE TRIP - YOU WILL BE TOO!
My boyfriend and I had an excellent early evening dinner
The weather was pleasant so we sat outside
Edith, our server, was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, without any snobbery
In fact, each member of the service staff was friendly and prompt, yet unobtrusive
Food hightlights: sea bass, codfish, speck salad, heirloom tomatoes, all in perfect portions
Oh, and you must try the chocolate-hazelnut trifle--to die for! As for wine, we tried a variety; they have a great by-the-glass selection, from which we got some excellent recommendations
The best spot for a high quality dining experience in a casual environment
We need more restaurants like Nice Matin!
ok-so it's crowded-a bit noisy-can get pricey
So! if you enjoy a place that's gonna give you a buzz - go here! I was there with 6 friends the other night without a reservation and had to wait about 30 min-even tho i live in the hood
it was cool because the Maitre d asked to see proof of residency and we both laughed-i guess he hears but i'm a neighbor all the time the bartender was so sweet and made the best cocktails in town
we were entertained and the staff did the best to keep it under control
we had a blast spent waaay too much money
hey why do i work if i cant splurge in my own neighborhood-dont listen to the cranky i want it my way now people-that's what burger king is for honey
please go there and keep this place around for all of us to enjoy!
I just finished eating a bland burger which i had taken home in a doggie bag after waiting over an hour for it
We first waited like 20 mins to get a menu and bread, then an extra 15 mins before our order was taken
The service was less than adequate, the manager had no clue, poured our wine, had seen we were waiting and never once asked us how everything was
This place is so pretentious it is funny and overpriced!! There are like 2 bottles of wine on the list less than $30
I would never recommend this restaurant, it was an awful experience
It looks so nice and posh and fancy but be warned it is not worth it at all
had a great time last friday nite -Maitre D' and his host staff very friendly and helpfull - especially since my friends were late for dinner - you MUST try their specialty drinks YUMMMM! all in all i would totally recomend this joint - music selection could be better
this place is hot and so like anywhere else that's is HOT - be prepared to wait enjoy a drink, relax and enjoy the nite out
OOH and the restaurant is named after the newspaper in NICE but does not translate into Good Morning
but it is good to go there morning , noon, and nite!
I had heard good things about this place
Unfortuantly, they were wrong
I eat here last week and found the sevice less then polite and the food didn't live up to it's reputation
I will not return or recomend this place until they fix the problems
The food is wonderful, but you must be willing to put in your time at the table
Service was good in nature but slow to deliver
The staff does seem overwhelmed as does the restaurant itself
A few more streamline menu choices would be a nice addition, but overall an excellent addition to the Upper West Side
Also, for as large as the restaruant is, the bathroom is TERRIBLEY SMALL and unequipt to handle the amount of people that use it
What an unpleasant experience! We had reservations for 8:30 from two days ago and we showed up right on time
They kept us waiting for an hour
Our reservation was for 3 people, so they made groups of 4 who came in much later than us sit down much before us
And all along, the maitre d' had a very foul attitude
She was definitely amon the most unpleasant and unprofessional maitre d' I came across over the years
The food was average
The waiter was very lax
Overall, not worth it
Went for brunch one morning loved it, got seated right away outside
We both noticed the service was a little slow but will always give a place a second chance
(the granola fruit is all cantalope honeydew) A few weeks later we were walking by and saw a lot of empty tables outside and decided to go in
The male host looked at us as if we were crazy and told us there was a 20 min wait
We left walking by the 8 empty tables
Tried Monaco across the road great food friendly staff
This place would be fine in a city full of patient people
We waited for 25 minutes to sit at one of the tables that was empty the whole time
Then, the service was atrocious
My husband asked for lemon six times, while I asked for my bagel four times
We complained on the way out (I never do this) and the manager shrugged
Too bad because the food was great, and the UWS is starved for good restaurants
TERRIBLE service- in search of a place for brunch, we happened to walk by this place and noticed some empty outside tables
We went in and asked for a table and were told that there would be a 20 minute wait- meanwhile, there were 7 empty tables along the sidewalk
We waited for about 25 mintues and not one table was filled and then we watched a couple that came in after us get seated
We inquired and were told that we were the next table so they showed us to an undesirable corner table
The waiter was wonderful but the management certainly needs improvement
It's obvious that this restaurant treats its customers like they should be lucky to dine there instead of the other way around
We came sans reservations, just at the beginning of the dinner hour, were seated immediately, at the last available table
Our attentive waiter came soon after, followed by the busboy carrying excellent bread and herbed butter
The starters (leeks vinaigrette, artichoke hearts in broth, an impeccably fresh salad of various lettuces), placed gently, were innovative in concept and presentation

I keep going back to this place b/c I love the steak and wine selection
Try a chapeau on your steak and don't pass on the horseradish mashed potatoes or collard greens with bacon and brown sugar
Everything here is delicious and the portions are standard for a steak place
The service was also attentive and professional
Chic and cozy, the atmosphere certainly lives up the hype
The fondue is a fun start and the salmon tartare was a bigger portion than I had anticipated
The dining experience was above average overall (aided by a great zinfandel), but my biggest complaint was with my cut of meat
It's difficult to find the grizzle in such dim lighting, so I found myself ingesting a lot more fat than I like, epsecially for the price
If dining for two, split the accessories
Unless you love bleu cheese, pass on the maytag bleu chive chapeau, as it overpowered the flavor of my NY strip
I traded my bleu cheese topping with my girlfriend for her wild mushroom truffle chapeaux, and we both agreed it was a finer pairing
Finally, there might be more exciting desserts, but the banana split is simply delectable
Took a lil trip to find but we hopped in a taxi and found it
i can't even begin to say what an amazing place
Me and my date had resevation at 10 and right on time were seated in the most comfortable booth overlooking all the wine bottles
romantic candlelight
The chocolate martinis got me quiet buzzed
I had the crabcakes for appetizer and they were amazing
The filet mignon was superior both cooked the way we asked
chocolate cake was out of this world
potatoes asparagus and mushroom sides were great
I went here with my girlfriend for our 1 year anniversary, and it was the most delicious meal I've had in a while
The waiter was exptremely friendly and attentive, the wine list was reasonably priced, and the steak makes my mouth water just thinking about it
You can have your steak prepared with a crispy parmesan and garlic topping that is like nothign you've ever tried
Highly recommended, especially for a romantic evening
A sexy place that doesn't pay attention to what's cooking
Every one of our 6 steaks was way overdone
And the side dishes are a joke--$7 for 3 tablespoons of spinach!!! This is supposed to be a steakhouse remember--excess should rule
On the plus side, the bar is very nice
Have a drink and go someplace else for steak
i love eating out and love it more when i am completely satisfied with my food
the waiter i had was cool and helpful, but i must say the steaks my boyfriend and i ordered were amazing
im a huge meat eater and at times disappointed at those expensive restaurants when they cant seem to cook a great steak
but this place was great, the sauces were yummy and i loved the side dishes
yes this place was definatley a little pricey
but isnt it worth it for excellent food?
I've been waiting to try Dylan Prime forever, so perhaps my expectations for the food were unreasonably high
It's a really well-designed restaurant
The extremely high ceilings are really cool
The seating is spaced nicely (so that you're not on top of the party sitting next to you)
It's a little loud
but I think in a good way
As for the food, I've had better
Tried the T-bone
the filet portion was miniscule (four bites at most)
The strip portion was a little dry
a little too fatty on the edges
Perhaps I chose the wrong cut though
For sides: creamed spinach was good; potato cakes had this strange bisquick-y taste about them
Skipped dessert because the portions were big enough to fill me up
Definitely willing to go back to try other selections
We had a great time at Dylan Prime
The fondue was delicious; the filet mignon and sea bass were also good
The martinis are nice too
However, I advise that you be VERY specific when ordering the meat because my husband said medium well and got a steak that was well done (with no pink in the middle)
Finally, the booths are cozy and it's romantic to sit close together on soft leather
Romantic from the outside, this place has great mood lighting
we got great food and service, but with a lot of noise
I didn't appreciate the seating, couples we're given the least privacy
our table was 6 inches from the next couple, in a row of 5
with regard to the food, it is quite good, but the plate presentation and garnish could use a lot of improvement
love that they use white crockery
overall, i would go again, not for romance, but for a night on the town
The filet mignon with blue cheese topping is unbelievably delicious! Dim lighting
very romantic
perfect place for a bridal party
LOVE Dylan Prime! I have been a few times, and it's one of my favorite restaurants in the city
Not your typical steakhouse in that it's sleek and swanky
The fondue appetizer is great, as are all the steaks and delicious sides!!! HIGHLY recommended!!!
Wonderful food
A nice suprise
Quality of the food was very good
Steaks prepared perfectly prepared, the fondue amazing - all good
Cant go wrong
Worth the price
Service was weak
They tend to leave you alone, which is typical of NYC
however it would be nice to find someone when you would like to pay the check
Location? (shaking my head)
Right now, it is certainly not PRIME, but I respect the location and what the area is trying to build for the future
I would go back - ONLY to drink - the Blue Cheese stuffed olives are genius!!   The steak was mediocure - the sides were ok
The salads were awful - completely tasteless - where does one find bad lettuce?? It took a bigger bite from my wallet than my appetite - I would not reccomend this to anyone that I would want to talk to me again!!
A fine dinning experience if you can find it
A little out of the way
Staff was courteous and the food was very good, not great
Better ambiance than Lugers, but the finest steak it was not
Caters to the business crowd
A Gem in Tribeca
Amazing food, great service, romantic, would recommend to all for a special nite out
outstanding
dylan prime's location, it's appearance and it's patrons exude pretension and new york chic, but believe me, this is a steakhouse in the truest sense of the word
the steak is fantastic, cooked to perfection
spinach, potatoes, desserts all exquisite
this place is one of those where you keep coming back even if its to have the same meal again
i am a bourbon drinker, and i find myself often disappointed with the way many bars mix manhattans -- but dylan prime DAZZLED -- a truly great manhattan -- perfect balance of bitters and bourbon -- their secret is a twist of lemon and orange oil
appetizers were not great, but the main course was well prepared -- and the sides were OUTRAGEOUSLY GOOD!!!! -- order the spagetti squash! service was terrible (empty water glasses, etc), but apologetic, so that wasn't so bad
definitely worth a visit!
One of the best steaks I have ever eaten, and I didn't have to be in a steakhouse to get it
This is a really very sexy restaurant with really great food
The waitstaff is excellent they are very attentive without being too agressive

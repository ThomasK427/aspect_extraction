Highly recommended if one is in the mood for comfort, cosiness and a relaxing evening with good food and wine
As soon as you walk in Ponte's you'll see what to expect the whole evening
the best service ever! I have never been treated so well
Then they bring you cheese and eggplant along with your bread
You'll have to stop yourself from filling up on that alone
Angry lobster is great even though I would have liked it a little spicier
Then we were asked if we would like our desert and coffee in the lounge
That area has couches and is very romantic
Can't wait to go back
This awesome restaurant located overlooking the hudson river and the statue of liberty in the financial district is a real treat with food and crowd and ambiance! dont miss the lobsters! Great party room!
I am so happy that I dined at this great restaurant
Although it was my first time it surely wont be my last!!!
I rarely enjoy Italian food but when I'm in NY I try to come here
Great food, excellent service - what more can you ask for?
I love this out of the way place and its sunset view, but it is rarely open
What's that all about?
This restaurant was very yummy years ago and is still pretty great!
WE ALL LOVED THE PLACE AND THE SERVICE,THE WAITERS ARE GREAT,AND THE FREE WINE CARD FROM THE OWNER WAS A NICE TOUCH
THE FOOD HAS GREAT FLARE AND TASTE
THE ROOM IS BEAUTIFUL,A BIT NOISY
What I loved about the lobster was that it wasn't your basic, drown this in butter to bring out the flavor
It was already cooked in a really tasty, spicy sauce
YUMMY!
If you visit Chinatown NYC enough you'll see this restaurant is just another Chinese restaurant with average food, service, value, and atmosphere
Its not terribly great, but not terribly bad
For tourists, it may be a place that will solidify their experience in Chinatown, but hardly memorable
We stopped there without knowing the place as tourists
Food was great, every soups and plates were great
Service was fair but we were not in rush hours
Maybe if they change a little bit the inside to be more attractice it will be a great place to go
The Scene The lights go out, the Arabic pop music comes on and an entourage of sexy servers waves sparklers as they dance around one of the evening's many birthday boys or girls
That's par for the course in this brightly painted, swanky dining room, where a young, international crowd fuels a fun (if slightly cheesy) vibe
Even the older, food-serious diners who sit far away from the loud bar are having a ball
The Food The Mediterranean-North African fare is more upscale than authentic
Fusion tapas, such as dry, under-seasoned raz-al-hanout duck spring rolls, are best avoided in favor of French and Spanish entrees like shellfish-stocked paella and juicy shell steak frite made with Argentinean beef
Best of all are the tagines, which arrive steaming hot in large, conical crocks: Both lamb with sweet dried fruit and tangy chicken with preserved lemons and olives are succulent successes
I went there for lunch with no reservation and was seated outdoors
We asked 3 times for menus and never got drinks until the food came and we complained
After that one of the servers insulted out loud to some other diners that we were complaining about our customer service
They don't care if you like it there and they don't care if you ever return
They are too arogant about their little restaurant
The food doesn't back up the attitude
Save your money for someone who cares to have it
Fun vibe, went to check it out on Monday for the Belly Dancers
Sat at the bar and orderd a few appetizers, the humus and cheese plates along with some calamari - all very tasty
I had the mini-burgers from the Tapas menu
They had great flavor and were cooked perfectly
I also downed a few glasses of their pinot gris
Tasty combo! The service was also cool
We were there for the belly dancing on Monday night
That was fun! I recommend for a date
I just had my 26th birthday party here last weekend
I had originally planned on having it somewhere else, but I am SO GLAD I didn't
It was amazing from the moment I walked in
The whole restaurant was a huge party
Everyone was dancing on their chairs to the great music (yes, it's loud, but I went there expecting that)
The service was a little slow, but SO friendly
I would rather not be rushed through my dinner, so my friends and I were ok with that
It was one of the best birthdays I ever had and everyone had a great time
I highly recommend L'Orange Bleue to others
This is not your average spot ! It is one great hidden summer treasures where all rules are made a la minute in a Soho-Boho-Yoho fashion on the best sidewalk cafe terrasse
On W-E you will squeeze within the mix of youger suits, older quadras and euphoric victims and obviously NY City's cutest waiters
The African/World music flows high-po, and all contributes to this Wizard of OB
Food's comfort food and simple
A NYorkers favorite
Mediterranean specialties like Tajines /Grilled whole fish/ Tapas-like Mezze platters are a sure win for groups
Great Pastas
Grandma's in the kitchen it seems ! I don't care what they say about these guys !Yes service can be slow at times but it is not arrogant it's just euphoric busy ! These guys have a magic and that is what makes the place special !! Energize yourself !! Don't like it ? Stay away
I planned my 30th birthday dinner for l'orange bleue and I was not pleased
The time I spent at the bar area was more enjoyable
The bartender was very nice there
We waited almost 30 minutes past our rsvp time for our table
It was given to another group before we were even asked if our party was ready yet
The servers were not helpful and did not describe the menu truthfully
The food (dinner) was not tasty but rather too salty and not appetizing
The chef needs to be more cautious about how the food is prepared and served
I only recommend this place for the music/drinks/bar and dancer's appearance which seemed to last about five minutes
Do not have dinner there
It was a dissappointment
We did a group dinner here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night
The chicken tangine was good - nuanced flavors, etc, but the service really does take FOREVER
We were there for almost three hours
you have to wait at least 20 minutes between each event (i
e
20 minutes before you get to order, 20 minutes before you get your appetizers, 20-30 minutes after you are done with your appetizer to get your main entree
I thought they would kick us out (we were a group of 10) so that they could seat another party, but NO, we had to wait an additional 20 minutes to get our bill after we asked
On the plus side, it is very FESTIVE
Lots of birthday parties and lots of people standing up on their chairs and dancing (if that is what you like)
We were seated 45 min after our reservation time without any apology (they called us on the day ealier asking to be on time
!) and to the table not large enough for the reserved # of people
So we had to ask and wait another 10 min to be seated decently
The waiter was very rude + not attentive, never came back to our table after dishes were brought and no thank you when we left
Music was just too-noisy and not in good taste
Food was so-so, but it was the most awful dinner I experienced in my life
Pls refer to low-scoring comments
They're all true
Just don't go this place
You will not forget your party at this Soho/boho mediteranean/french/african-moroccan party place
It seem the entire restaurant is having a party and it is loud in here (music and people)
NYork's cutest waiters and lady friendly will help younger suits to older quadra's to have fun and feel comfortable

The essential example of how a serving has grown in proportion to the collective American ass
Give me Murray's!!!
Anonymous obviously is not from NY
Bagels outside of NY are horrible so people HAVE to toast them to eat them
Murray's bagels are delicious
no need to disguise the taste
If you want to eat toast, buy a loaf of bread
I give Murry's the edge over Ess-a-Bagel and HH, though depending on the batch, each place's bagels are great and can beat each other
Murry's gets the edge because it tastes great (like a real bagel), has friendly quick service, and has a lot more to offer--ambience, other food and desserts, and beverages (decent coffee)
So what if they don't toast and they aren't the cheapest place? Other places have half the quality and charm and charge the same or more
No offense to the 5/3 reviewer, but quit your whining and take your medication--Murry's is a mom-and-pop place and comparing it to Ranch 1 is absurd
Going there once in a bad mood does not give you the authority to dismiss its great bagels
Murray's isn't cheap
And it's true, they don't toast
But god, these bagels are good! Firm, chewy, not too doughy
If you're a penny-pincher, get a 1/4 lb
of your favorite salad, then order your bagel dry--it's cheaper than a sandwich
The Scene Back-lit bamboo branches create a three-dimensional arch above candlelit tables
It's a stylish setting, but the most coveted spot for serious fish fiends lies further back: With just six seats, the sushi bar allows diners to have what is essentially their own private sushi chef for the night
Co-owner Jack Lamb swings about the place, smoothly extolling the virtues of each sake in a swift, showy fashion
The Food Young sushi chef Masato Shimizu deftly slices, shapes and presents each piece of fish with irresistible enthusiasm
Splurge on an omakase dinner, and course after course will arrive, beginning with tiny bites of tuna tartare and rich bits of monkfish liver, progressing to a breathtaking rainbow of sashimi, which might include a trio of yellowtail tunas culled from different parts of the fish
Sushi is the finale, and offbeat offerings like horse mackerel are par for the course
Disappointment! Disappointment! Disappointment! What was once a jewel box in east village is now a box full of suited snobby waiters and maitre'd
Staff acted too superior and service was just simply rude
As for the food, apart from the Chef's Omakase, the appetizers and rolls are just below mediocre for the price they charged
If snobbery is your cup of tea, Jewel Bako will definitely make you feel at home
Otherwise, stay away!
I went here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and we did the $90 per person omakase (because it was worth splurging considering the occasion)
Anyhow, the food was amazing, the waitress was extremely helpful with selecting sakes, and the service was impeccable
I'm actually shocked at the reviews that talk about the service, because both of us agreed it was the best we had ever had
I do understand that every evening can be different, but that's pretty surprising
The sushi at Sushi Yasuda may have been a tad better (I'm basically splitting hairs), but it was one of the best meals of my life
Definitely not cheap, but these days in New York, you could do a lot worse in terms of value
It really is a wonderful place
I went here expected great sushi and I got ripped off
I had to pay OBSCENE prices
$60 omakase for 10 pieces of sushi
They were delicious but what I want when I go out is to feel sated and I didn't come even close
I would NEVER never go back here
I feel cheated
If you're interested in design, ok
But if you're hungry and craving sushi, forget about it! Way overpriced, tiny obnoxious portions, mediocre food, uninventive menu, and an overall unsatisfying experience
Need I say more?
so this is a second shot at reviewing this place, apparantly my first review was not appropriate for citysearch
So let me get into some detail about my meal
the sushi could have been fresher for the price, the service could have been more genuine for the price and the owners could have been less condesending
I recently went to Jewel Bako for a friend's birthday (11 of us) and the service was appalling
There were only three menus for the 11 of us, and the restaurant wasn't totally full which makes you kind of wonder
When we were ready to order, there was noone to serve us
It took two hours from the point we sat down, til the point that we got our food
We ordered some apps but only half of them came
They completely forgot my meal, saying they thought I was sharing with someone else
Funny thing about actually ORDERING THE MEAL, you think it's going to come
Of course the bill was insanely expensive, as we were just drinking nice wine while we were waiting forever for the food to come
I can't tell you how APPALLING the service was
Omakase at the bar from Masato at Jewel
You can not do better than that
Masato is not only a master, skillfully creating the freshest and often most unique pieces of sushi, but he is also a mentor who will provide you with tasty bits of sushi info
I leave spending a lot but never have I felt it wasn't worth every penny
Simply the best experience
Jack Lamb has really got something perfect going on here
There are a few places that may have Jewel slightly beat in a couple of categories but none come even close to the wonderful time you will have experiencing Omakase at the bar from Masato at Jewel
Thank You
After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a bit weary, but we had reservations and were seating immediately
Not only was our service great, but they may have been a bit overbearing
So many people were coming by asking to take our drink orders, refilling our drinks, and clearing our table
The service was incredible and the sushi was fantastic
Yes, it's a bit pricy, but good sushi is going to be
It probably helped that we got there early (7:30pm) before the rush, but I would absolutely recommend this place!
Contrary to many of the previous reviews, I had a fantastic time dining at Jewel Bako
Fortunately, it wasn't over crowed when we arrived, so we were seated and served immediately
The Omakase tasting menu was great and each item was explained to us when it was served
When our table got a little crowded by all of the plates, the table next to ours was added to provide us with more room, even though it could have been used to seat another party
Yes, it was pricey, but the food and attentive staff was definitely worth the price
Have to agree with many other posters
The customer service is atrocious at this restaurant
After waiting over an hour and a half for a reservation we were seated in a cramped table, our waiter, also the owner was extremely rude and obnoxious throughout the entire process
I have never been treated so badly in all of my entire New York City dining experiences
I am always shocked when I see this restaurant listed as having some of the best customer service in guides year after year
Obviously if you aren't in with the owners you are going to get nowher
Plus the portions are very small and the bill is astounding
Do yourself a favor and don't eat here! There are so many other good places to eat in NYC
This place has a lot of hype, but it ain't worth the $
Great ambience and service, but the sushi is not a lot better than most other Manhattan joints and a lot more expensive
Been there several times before and after the renovation
Kinda miss the intimacy of the original space, but the additional seating was needed
The sushi is always excellant
It is prepared with care and always includes something interesting
Service is always attentive
Yes, it is pricey (and the sake is not cheap either)
Yes, this is not an all you can eat slab sushi place
Yes, it is still a small place and when it gets busy you may have to wait a moment to get your water refilled
Nevertheless, the staff works hard
I like the place despite all of its charms (which obviously bother some others a little too much IMHO - if you are a spoiled patron type, you best go some place else in a fancy neighborhood)
I appreciate this place and recommend it - a guilty, costly pleasure
I do not understand why this restaurant is considered one of the best
They don't make any cocktails - only 2 martinis which they brought over from Makimono which were made with bottled juice! Also, there are very few things to eat
We know good sushi from bad, and while the fish is extremely fresh and probably top top quality - the experience was not worth the money
The restaurant is also a little clautrophobic

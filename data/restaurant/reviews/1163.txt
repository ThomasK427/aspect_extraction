Service, food, ambiance - couldn't give a complaint if I tried
My partners and I will definitely become repeat patrons and are looking forward to our next Sapa experience
Thank you Citysearch!
Although the food was good, not the best though, the service was terrible and the music was way too loud to have a conversation
It certainly was not a night to remember
This is a beautiful brand new restaurant
The Lighting is just perfect and the music is a mix of sexy house music
Food was good
not great
Server were kind and knew their stuff
The Crowd
mmmmmmm
A little too old fart for my taste
But overall it was a a good experience
I had the spare rib appetizer - the meat was tender but the sauce was a bit too salty for me (and I like salty food)
The tuna spring rolls were very good
The ribeye steak I had was good (cooked to a perfect medium rare), as was my girlfriend's sea bass
The vegetable fried rice side dish was very good, but the broccoli tempura was too greasy
For desert, we shared the pumpkin cake, which was mediocre
The chocolate chip cookies were a nice touch from a service perspective, but the cookies themselves were average
The place can get very loud, so don't expect a romantic evening here
All in all, it was a decent meal but dinner for two came to $172 with tip
For this much money, I can think of better places, or places that are just as good for less
Stopped by for happy hour and appetizers
Gorgeous lounge area
Had a few glasses of the $5 happy hour priced sauvignon blanc
Wonderful! And then shared a plate of calamari and french fries
The fries were a bit salty
but all in all, such a pleasant experience
Would be an excellent date restaurant or for special occasions
I am looking forward to trying the tasting menu here sometime
In my opinion, a tasting menu is the only way to truly appreciate a restaurant's cuisine
Sapa has a delicious 6 course menu w/ wine pairing
Each dish had their own distinct flavor which paired quite well with the selected wine
The decor is absolutely stunning
Many new trendy restaurants put too much emphasis on decor and slack on the food
Sapa has managed to blend a stunning decor, delicious food, and a beautiful clientele
Very well done
Our new favourite restaurant
All of our group of six loved the food
Can't fault the service, which appears with complimentary trays of appetizers / cookies during the evening
The bathrooms are gorgeous! For such a nice atmosphere delicious dishes, the bill was relatively low
They have a special dish for vegetarians (not printed on the menu)
Sapa is at once zen, cozy and sceny
I live in the nighborhood, and enjoy lazy Sunday evening dinners, as well as the pre-going out dinner on Saturday nights when the people watching in the restaurant is prime
Sapa is an oasis, and the attentive, warm service and the inventive drinks bring it right to the top of my most-frequented restaurants list
Patricia Yeo's food is brilliant and never ceases to amaze me with its original flavor combos
I love seeing the Chef, the owners, and the rest of the staff buzzing around the place on any given evening in order to ensure a top experience for all customers
This is a place that connects with its clients, and it is always, always fun!  N

The Happy Hour is the best I've ever been too, and the chocolate chip cookies that are passed around throughout dinner are to die for
Went here to celebrate my anniversary per suggestion from a friend
The food is just absolutely amazing
We had the foie gras strawberry shortcake and the rice paper roll sampler
Both were great
For the main course we had the miso braised shortrib and the cod roasted in parchment with a side of fried rice
The portions are huge but then again the prices are a bit steep
Everything was so yummy
You can't leave without having the chocolate chili bombe
It's a great combo with the lime sorbet
Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Sapa
I would definitely recommend it
But yes, the hostess was a bit snobby
The hostess and wait staff are negating the excellent efforts of the kitchen
The food was very good but the phony, snobbish, unaccommodating hostess made my decision clear to never go back
Our waiter was fine but the other wait staff was grabby/greedy in taking unfinished plates away in an effort to turn the table
Music was a little to loud to allow conversation
Tip: take your drinks down to the bathroom, which is beautiful, and sit by the pool for any hope of conversation
Although some might say the atmosphere is a bit over the top (as in, they try too hard), I really dig it
Music is at the perfect level, crowd is trendy but not snobby
Candlelight creates just the right amount of light and ambience
I love the wall covered with lit votives- it's beautiful
Food is amazing
Portions are small and staff is inattentive sometimes, but the dishes are extremely flavorful
Spring Roll Sampler Plate is a MUST for all diners
Cocktail menu is also incredible
Definitely on same level as Spice Market and Pastis
Try the Ginger Passionfruit Margarita- it's incredible!
the decor, the music, the lightning all contribute to the entrance of a delicious spread
Food was very good, great fusion and your taste buds will definitely be satisfied
We also got fresh bake chocolate chip cookies at the end of our meal right before dessert!
The restaurant is beautiful but insanely loud
Service is OK
I think the wait staff are spread too thin to offer superb service
Spicy tuna roll is excellent
besides that, everything else was average
Sapa is gorgeous
Cool, pre-war architecture done in a modern, simplistic setting with great lighting makes this a gorgeous dining space
It is a great place to go with a big group as your group will feel ultra-comfortable in this grand setting
The menu is limited but good with rice paper rolls being a house specialty
I had the rib-eye steak which was a little fatty for my taste but, other entree options looked very good
I had a mussell/clam appetizer to die for
The waitstaff was attentive and great
Insider tips: The martinis come in HUGE glasses, the bathroom is beautiful, go, if only to wash your hands, happy hour features $5 martinis and $1 clams but you can only get this at the bar
We had our Cocktail Engagement Party at SAPA on Sept 3rd 2005 and it went seamlessly
And I mean seamless!! We had passed hor 'dourves and open bar in the lounge for 40 guests (We even requested our own signature drinks) My fianc and I are huge fans of fusion cuisine and were extremely pleased with everything! Our guests were relaxed, the food was amazing and the staff was an absolute delight
Now everyone cant wait for our wedding
Kudos to the entire team at SAPA
We certainly impressed our out of town guests   Highly recommended!
Usually, restaurants with the kind of beautiful decor like Sapa serve bland, tasteless and expensive food

I had a veal dish with mushroom sauce and truffle oil, while my boyfriend opted for mustard glazed salmon
Both meals were just fabulous, carefully prepared with a perfect balance of spices
Overall, I highly recommend this place!
Although it was snowing on the night we visited, the trip to this ristorante in Kip's Bay is positively worth it in any conditions
Kept superbly clean, the menu is always reinventing itself and is presented by a friendly staff
The wine is equally impressive, and the atmosphere and price will surely make this a fun time for anyone
This Murry Hill italian restaurant is a true diamond in the rough
Still to be discovered by the masses
Dolcino treats each customer like a Good Fella
Quiet, Cozy, and comfortable
these guys are all ex-Sparks employees, so the service is top tier
The menu is described poetically, and the prices are extremely reasonable
If you want a great place to have a quiet romantic dinner with one or many
Dolcino's is your place
If they happen to have the Lobster Fra Diavlo
definitely get it!
Mario and the crew make you feel right at home! A welcome addition the neighborhood, Dolcino makes an extra effort to assure you a wonderful evening
The specials are always a winner
Friendly service and quality food at reasonable prices do the trick
If you're looking for a great italain restaurant with great service and great food, look no further
Dolcino has top of the line food with the best service in the city
It's really a hidden treasure in Manhattan
So if you're looking to have a delicious meal- this is the place
Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late
I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite
The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion)
The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM
For all of you new to Indian food, try the Paneer Roll, it is a piece of heaven
I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down
As a regular, I never cared about the long waits
Today however, my experience made me vow never to return
It was mostly empty
A young guy (the owner ?) was in charge instead of the older chef
He told the guy in front of me in Hindi that he was making his order despite others waiting before him! I placed my order and waited
Meanwhile, people entered AFTER me, placed orders and got them! The only other group there had already eaten, now placed a new order
Minutes later, the owner made my order and gave it to this group who couldn't tell the difference between their order and mine
The owner only served those who he was conversing with (the group) forgetting the only customer waiting for about 25 minutes!  UGH!
I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot
It's true, this place is not cheap
I need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14
00! They are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city
However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street
Kati Roll serves numerous fillings (tandoori chicken, paneer, etc
) wrapped in piping hot parathas
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti
Amazing!
Oh ignore the one and only negative review, that person just is using it to plug Mamoun's next door
Kati Rolls are my favorite meal in the city - super cheap and great quality and delciious, what more could you ask? The chicken tikka roll is fabulous, buttery soft bread wrapped around spicy great chickena nd onions, made fresh to order
it is my favorite
They get slow when it is crowded since they do make everything fresh for each order but tha tis the only drawback
Uhh, I don't get it
This guy thinks he's the soup nazi or something
He loves yelling at people for no reason, and refusing service, but trust me
he's no soup nazi, or even Azuri for that matter
The rolls are nothing special
For one thing, they're tiny; one Kati roll is not filling at all
For another thing, the rolls are really dry and the quality varies greatly from roll to roll
At any rate, even if the rolls were as good as advertised, nothing would excuse the psychotic yelling of the chef every five minutes
Skip the dramatically psycho chef here and go eat some real food at Mamoun's
The taste reminds one of the street vendors of karachi selling kebab rolls and chicken rolls
A place worth a visit for all kebab roll lovers
two thumbs up!
in india, they had these street vendors which basically sold you some quick snacks/food
You usually see them in cities like Bombay
Well
that's what the Kati-Roll is
an equivalence of the food
The stuff is good, tasty, and cheap
I mean real tasty! Definitely recommended for anybody!!
The food is terrific
Good ambience and only known to those who know good food
Forget chicken and rice
Unda Chicken roll is the way to go!
This bright, chic, but small place is ALWAYS packed with trendy people (or students) when my friends and I come here for a late-nite mouth-watering snack! The kati roll- a whole wheat paratha (tortilla), w a beef, chicken, or potato kebab filling (comes w or w/out omlette inside), is packed w onions, chutney- is cheap ($4), big, and DELICIOUS! Be prepared to wait 15 min during rush times (9-11pm; and PLEASE DON'T be rude to the servers), but it's worth it!!!
The Scene The cozy, brightly lit dining room is adorned with photos of Italy and dominated by a large, brick pizza oven
The Neapolitan owners who run the place exude friendliness, and attract a neighborhood clientele, mostly in couples and small groups
The Food The restaurant offers a selection of pastas and other entrees but the pizza is top-notch, with an old-school crust that's thin but not brittle
Pies are divided into two categories: "Classiche" includes Margherita, quatro stagioni and other perennial favorites; while "Fantasie" includes smoked salmon, Nutella, pineapple, egg and other non-traditional ingredients
A standout is the quattro formaggi, made with fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, fontina and Parmigian cheese
Entrees include an excellent porcini risotto, a great baked gnocchi with meat ragu, and a simple, nicely cooked Cornish game hen
The food was amazing
I reccomend the Pacherri w/ shredded beef and the seafood soup
The staff was very friendly, which you don't encounter often
Really the most satisfying meal I've had in NYC and I've lived here for almost 2 years
this brick oven pizza is THE best in new york
authentic italian
great food ans staff! love it!
A few friends from the hood reccommeded this place - and i LOVED it! Great food and friendly folks!

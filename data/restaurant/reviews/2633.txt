The filet mignon is the best I've had anywhere in the city--cooked perfectly to temperature
They have a good solid list of Italian wines that are very reasonably priced
The service was great without being intrusive
The entire vibe of the place is very neighborhoody and cozy
Our waiter said it was a family owned business and the staff have been there for years
It really comes across in the dining experience
You must try this place!
Almost great restaurant - I really appreciate the fact that their menu is all organic free-range, and yet you don't feel like you need to be wearing Birkenstocks to eat there
The food was delicious and creative
Unfortunately, we had wanted to eat outside, but they were burning incense in both the front and the back garden
We had to sit indoors where they had the air conditioning turned up a bit too high, and the artwork on the walls was uninspiring
If they'd ditch the incense and put up some slightly less surreal art, they'd be perfect
My friends and I shared a pleasant evening in the outdoor garden at Luxia
It was warm outside in the city but very relaxing in the garden
The mood was so tranquil it was easy to forget you're in the middle of New York City
The service was punctual, having been asked for our drink orders even before opening our menus
It was a warm day and we didn't have to search for a refill of our water glasses as they were being consistantly tended to
I had the argula salad that was just about as good as anything I've had with a dressing that was just perfect and not overbearing
It came with goat cheese that was fried on the outside but very moist inside (an excellant touch)
I also had the lamb sausage which was spicey but that's the way I like it and I loved it
It was complimented with a side of tender potatoes and seasoning that danced along my tongue
For the main course I ordered the special swordfish and I can say it was very special
Its hard to find a place that doesn't over cook or under cook swordfish but this was perfect
I was given a very generous piece of fish and the center was very tender
One of my friends had the special ravioli that had four different types of cheeses within, unbelievably tasty
It was also served with a red sause that was very light, a nice mix
The bar comes with an assortment of different flavored vodkas so there is quite a choice for drinks
The house white wine was very refreshing, not very dry and with a hint of sweetness
The house red had a very good body, great aroma and it was very smooth going down
This was a wonderful and satisfying experiance and I've thought about returning ever since I left
I was recommended to Luxia by a friend and could not believe how perfect everything was! From appetizers to desserts - everything was delicious!
The service was impeccable and I would definitely go back!
Thank you for an amazing evening!
Luxia was the worst dining experience I ever had in my life
The host was exteremely rude, obnoxious and snooty
He managed to ruin our whole evening
Food? What food?
This place is phenomenal
hands down this is a very sexy and romantic restaurant and has great food to boot
They have the freshest food and sexiest presentation
The crab cakes are to die for (and no I don't work there and I'm not getting any incentives, unfortunately)
Anyway, I luv this place
totally worth checking out after work, not much as far as single men but still very lovely!
Luxia had been recommended to me by someone I trusted
I will never trust this person again with a recommendation
The food was awful-undercooked meat, the service worse-a snooty, obnoxious host followed by a waiter who couldn't get the order correct (when there were maybe 12 people in the whole place)
My partner and I actually laughed at how horrible the restaurant was
Having been there in the past once, I expected a wonderful time
I'm not sure if the management changed or if they just decided they were far too important to actually treat their guests with courtesy
While the food was fine, the snooty maitre'd rushed us through our meal, gave loud obnoxious tours of the restaurant during our dinner and ruined what could have been a beautiful evening
The pre-theater prix fixe menu offered many options -- we chose the pasta of the day and the vegetarian tapas
While the pasta was good, the tapas were outstanding
Medium portions of black beans in a tasty, chunky tomato sauce, FRESH grilled corn (just cut off the cob and very sweet), and a mushroom medley
Perhaps best of all was the tiramisu we chose for dessert
Service could have been more attentive
We had to ask for a set of salt pepper shakers for our table, and to ask for our wine to be served before dinner, and coffee was not offered when dessert was served; again we had to ask
The list of wines by the glass is short, but the pinot noir we selected was very good
It's nice to go to a restaurant that isn't well-publicized and be so pleasantly surprised with it
It's also good to have a know a place to impress one's NYC friends who tend to know every restaurant out there
The outdoor garden at this place is the best outdoor dining spot I've seen in NYC
The organic theme is interesting, and the mediterranean food is very well prepared
The wine list is small, but had wines from practically everywhere
My girlfriend loved her fruit martini
The chocolate bread pudding with gelato was an excellent finish to a good meal
Overall: A great place for a relaxing night, good food and drinks
The drinks at happy hour are great, the food preparation, presentation and value excellent, but the tables are too small
If you are a party of 3, as we were, we were seated at a table for 2
The table was so small we had to remove the bread when our entrees were served
We were told that this would not happen again, but this was the second time this has happened
Too bad, it is otherwise a good value and enjoyable meal
Excellent - took Mom there before a show; a number of excelleny dishes made the trip a very worthwhile trip - considering what you have to choose from in this neighborhood - a real find!
It's not easy to find an organic restaurant in the Theatre district, but here is one and the food is great
The crab cakes may be the best in the city
My friend had a shrimp appetizer that was very tasty
Entrees were equally surprising
Other reviewers mentioned how good the martinis are, they were not exaggerating
They have such a variety of them that I would have liked to have tried more of them, but they are so big that I could not have done so without crawling out
There was also a jazz band the night that I went
They played really well, considering that there wasn't a cover
Good time
The service was terrible! I went to Luxia with a large group, my meal never came, they kept asking what I got but never brought anything, additionally they brought the wrong meal to my friend
So we waited, and waited
Finally when everyone was done and they were bringing the coffee and desserts out my chicken arrived
COMPLETLEY UNCOOKED
And they still charged us for it! Great garden, wonderful drinks, but terrible service
Great food, great service, great patio, great location, great drinks
just great
This is my favorite neighborhood bar
Great Service at Great Prices! The staff is very friendly and they have the best fruit infused martinis
Go for happy hour where the martinis are $7 each
Check out the garden too!
My boyfriend took me here on one of our first dates and was I impressed! Very cozy and tucked away
Wonderful food and service! Highly recommended for a summer night, ask for seating on their porch which features a large oak tree with hanging Japonese laterns
Great wine list and cocktails!
Although the front of Luxia is very unassuming, inside is an adorable, romantic, relaxing, classy, soothing and beautiful patio lounge (live jazz some nights)/restaurant (all organic products)/bar (excellent fruit infused martinis)
After your first trip, you will become and instant regular
Don't miss the European style pation tucked away in the backyard, it might be the cutest nook in mid-town
I have been to Luxia on a number of occasions
It is always a nice place to visit either for the dining or the drinking
The huge martinis certainly are the best in the city, and the food was amazing for the price

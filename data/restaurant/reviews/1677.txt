My roommate and I share the same birthday, so we decided to treat ourselves by going with two other girlfriends to Battery Gardens, and I can safely say this was the best birthday dinner I've ever had
The food was absolutely phenomenal; every bite was perfect
The service was fast but not overbearing; they brought out appetizers and entrees swiftly but gave us plenty of time to linger over our meals
In addition, the decor is lovely, and the view is unbelievable
But what really rounded out the night was our service, which was impeccable
For whatever reason, and I don't think it was just the birthdays, the wait staff bent over backwards to make our evening perfect
In the end, all four of us got two rounds of drinks for free (including a delicious grappa) and my roommate and I also got our desserts gratis
AND some of the servers came over to sing happy birthday
It was amazing
While I doubt they do this every day, the wait staff was so wonderful I didn't need to get the special treatment to have a fantastic evening
We had such a lovely time that we promised our waiter and the bartender that we would be back for happy hour - and we most definitely will
Highly, highly recommended
I was so amazed when I came here the first time for a catered function, I decided to bring my mom aunt for a Mother's Day brunch
They loved the atmosphere, food and service
The only downer was the fruit fondue desert from the prie fixe menu wasn't as good as it looked (the chocolate was runny), and the wait between our salad and main course was too long
The rest of the food was creative and delicious
I would definitely like to come again
Maybe I can hint to my boyfriend to come here for my birthday
Maybe the most amazing outdoor setting in the city
views of the Statue of Liberty from the very tip of Manhattan Island where the East and Hudson rivers meet,
and ohmygosh the food
opt for the sea bass, maybe a pizza and defintely have the chocolate dessert sampler
What a great place to have a party or major celebration
Great staff
very cool crowd, awesome concept executed very, very well!!
My experience at Battery Gardens will not soon be forgotten
The food and service were outstanding, accompanied by one of the most spectacular views the city has to offer
I recommend sitting outside on a nice day to take in the full experience the resturant has to offer
The Chilaen Sea Bass is a must and the brick oven pizzas are yummy as well
The chochalte trio dessert had to be my favorite though
I will be sure to go back there soon!!
The food was terrible
Pre-Fixe menu for Easter proved to be the worsed served catered meal
We felt we were at a bad wedding
Crab cakes were burnt, and had specs of crab meat with a horrible sauce dribbled mostly on the dish
Salad was old
Chicken was hard and dry, rice was overcooked, string beans were okay (well thank you) and even the dessert was terrible
A fondue that the chocolate was watered and came out of a can along with the fruit
You should be ashamed to serve this at the prices you charged
And, then the service was rushed, although half the place was empty
Final topper - they charged for a refill of coffee
So overpriced, terrible food, poor service
Oh, the glass of champagne was served warm, but they did bring another glass without charging
Oh my, what a mess!
battery gardens is a gem in
it's location is without equal in manhattan
located at the bottom of manhattan island where the east and hudson rivers meet, you'll find few views better
when the weather allows, the outdoor dining has no equal
likewise, the outdoor bar is key, attracting the bold and the beautiful
however, regardless of weather, the food is excellent, the service friendly and efficient and i have yet to meet someone who was dissappointed when they left
I went to dinner there the other evening because a friend recommended it to me
Battery Gardens is an oasis in the big city
The menu is creative and well executed
Everybody was very friendly, especially the owner
I will definitely return again in the summer for dinner on the patio
I have lived downtown for several years and finally made it over to Battery Gardens
The views are absolutely beautiful
This is one of the most romantic places in the city
The sea bass was too die for
The service was good and the staff is friendly
As it turns out the ownership of the restaurant has changed about a year ago and everything is completely different
So don't be fooled by the old reviews
I can't wait to go back
As someone else mentioned I was a bit skeptical in trying this restaurant out as some of the reviews are not very positive
However, my boyfriend and I decided to go during the 4th of July ('05) and we had a great experience
The full menu was offered and everything was great
The location as well as the ambiance is wonderful and would recommend it if you are looking for a nice evening out (on the water)
Although the info states casual to dressy it is actually pretty casual
I will definitely return
I read some mixed reviews on citysearch but decided to give this place a shot
If you go on a sunny day the view is  absolutely gorgeous
The space is very airy, modern and a big contrast to most of the closets I eat in uptown
My only complaint is waiting a bit between the appetizer and the main course but it was well worth it
The Miso Cod is out of this world! The menu definitely had a lot of attractive offers too

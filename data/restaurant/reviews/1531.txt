I've eaten at every great chinese restaurant and the spicy beef dish here was just divine
The soup dumplings were also very good, as was the lobster sauce
Well worth the trip
We ordered from here after finding it on Zagats where it has a 23 rating for food
Sadly, I cannot agree
We ordered the orange flavored beef which was not even edible, let alone distiguishable as beef
The chicken and peanuts was mediocre
To give credit where credit is due: the pan fried dumplings were decent
I will not order from here again
This used to be my favorite chinese delivery spot but perhaps management has changed because the quality of food has fallen off completely
Hoping for their old cubed filet I was instead presented with a greasy mound of fatty steak in an unappetizing sauce
It was inedible
One of the best Chinese restaurants in Manhattan and a great value
The food is consistently good and authenthic
The chefs are all from mainland and they haven't been americanized yet
His other restaurants on 51st and 37th are also good
The menu is interesting and he has a great sense of humour
The Grand Sichuans run by this chef are the best Sichuan in the city
And cheap too
I've been several times and always order the Sichuan dishes
There is lots more on the menu, but i cannot comment on anything else
This review is so brief maybe some will find it not very helpful, but there isn't really anything more to say, it is all around the best
NYC is lucky to have this place
Let's hope they continue to keep the authentic food top notch and the prices reasonable
Service can suffer when it is crowded
Branch on Lexington and 33rd does not seem to have this problem-- yet
Also becuse of its popularity and almost constant state of filled-to-capacity, the Chelsea menu is shorter (relatively speaking, as it is quite extensive) than other branches with the same chef, like Lexington
If you crave authentic, spicy sichuan food, look no futher than Grand Sichuan
There's a beef dish, can't remeber the name that was the spiciest chinese dish I have ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot) and it was great
I've been to the other locations (Hells Kitchen, Canal Street) and find this one to be the best
From what I gather each has different owners and for me the Chelsea location stands out
It's not the friendliest place in the world, and waiting for a table here is a drag so try to come during off-peak times or carry out
It's the real deal for sure
Went there yesterday eve first time and the food was quite good and very generous portions
However, we found a piece of cardboard in one of our mains, alerted the waiter and all he did was take it and walk away
Fairly inexpensive but you only get what you pay for
A neighborhood favorite, you need to get there early on Sunday nights when there is a line for tables
The straight forward frech tasting food is even better brought to your home
Try the General Tso's or let them chose for you!
It is always a favorite hangout place for Asians who love authentic Sichuan
The food is good and reasonably priced
But it is a long wait during the weekend
Simply addictive
Their Sichuan specialties are truth to the orgins, and I can't resist it
The prices are great
Very authentic Sichuan food
Restaurant can get crowded which only proves its popularity
Long menu filled with interesting stories about different menu items
My girlfriend is Korean, and her family loves Hanbat
We tend to go once a week for the hot stone pot, seafood pancake, and kalbi tang
I would highly recommend this restaurant -- it has great food, among the best in Korea Town, and it is the best value
Usually I don't dine out to Korean since they're often on the spendy side
But if you're in the mood for Korean cuisine that's not too bad on the wallet - Hanbat is it
Management must have spruce up the place abit since it looks cozier
For those on the budget and want Korean
Head over to Woorijip food court on 12 W
32 street (writing this down as we speak based on a takeout menu)
They have prepared food and a noodle/ casserole soup menu
There isn't much ambiance but at least you don't have to pay for tip
I spent over a year in South Korea and enjoyed (most) Korean food immensely
Hanbat has a great selection of typical Korean dishes that are all served with side dishes and come from the kitchen piping hot
It is a great place to go when you are hungry and looking for a casual, inexpensive meal
The gopdol bibimbap and the soondooboo chigae are delicious and the pajun is scrumptious! Try the sulrang tang if you are looking to cure a hangover
Traditional Korean BBQ is not a specialty here so go elsewhere if that is what you're craving
Easily seated, good food, great prices
The perfect stop when in midtown
The club sandwiches are fabulous, and the dessert list is enticing!
This is a great place if you are craving some authentic, spicy Indian food
Their portions are big - the dosas are huge
The atmosphere is just not even near fancy, but you'll have no problem enjoying your food
Waiters are very friendly too, and I can never stop eating and come out very satisfied =)
i visited this place first in summer 05, when we ordered indian snacks, my (also indian) girlfriend ordered and told them how to prepare it (ingredients etc) it came out great and the service was good
I came back in oct solo and tried their paio bhaji
tasted like it was reheated frozen food
on another occassion i tried the thali with roti rice and chana puri
it was OK
but nothing really to rave at
The service was good and food definately better than minar but i could have paid 1/2 the price and gotten same tasting food! PS the guyanese girl behind the counter who takes your order is pretty cute ;)
what can i say? i love this place and travel many blocks to munch out on dosas and sip my chai
i happen to love the down home ambiance
huge menu
set up is typical of restaurants you'll find in indian cities
the staff is warm and homey
anyonme who knows indian, knoes dimple
YUM! ps
best shrikant in new york!
I just moved across the street and cannot get enough of this delicious, homestyle vegetarian indian cuisine
The wonderful staff are as warm and friendly as the wide variety of indian dishes
From blended rices to samosas to several everchanging entries, the place ROCKS
They also have a wonderful tasty desert selection of homemade pastries and candies
First rate
Decor, so so
but who cares anyhow?
The food here is great but bear in mind, it is not the typical Indian restaurant with a fancy expensive menu and heavy curry foods
All snacky and Indian fast food, what we call CHAAT, the real yummy, tangy and exotic food
The restaurant has excellent food but closes at 8 PM, and is not the fanciest ambiance
The food is cheap and please don't torture it by ordering delivery
must be eaten fresh!
i have tried their chicken noodle soups, chicken sandwich choco cheesecake
all their food tastes processed and full of fatty starch

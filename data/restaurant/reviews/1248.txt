Service was great and very nice decor
Not really that romantic but still a nice place for a date or especially with a group
My girlfriend is taking her parents back now tonight for mothers day
MY main complaint is we ate so much food we didnt even bother with dessert
The concept of this restaurant can be fun as it is great to try alot of different things but there were too many different tastes/flavors and most of them were inedible
Nothing really brought to mind Italian food and I wouldn't recommend this place ever especially if you don't have alot of $$$$ and want a great meal
Hard to find a poor restaurant in NYC but this one was for me
friday night dinner
9:30
pretty sure there were three servers on the floor
no idea which of these three's section we were in
water service to dessert, we never had a server
no manager around either
why bother cooking better than average food when your guests can't be guaranteed silver when it arrives
bite the bullet and staff the floor
labor costs might be offset by increased sales if tables have a server
just a thought
Why waste time here? Food was horrible, service worse
They did not have 1 out of the 5 wines by the glass - and did not have a replacement, yet 100 bottles of wine in their huge wine cellar
Waiter spilled a decent amount of water on my friend's plate -and then walked away - didn't remove the plate! Forgot to bring the mozzarella and when it did arrive it looked and tasted like rubber
waiter told us he was swamped which I can't understand when it's not hard to go into the kitchen and scream, TABLE 4, all 3 course
Not too much you can mess up
He bitched about having to split the check on credit cards and his quote was, Are you kidding me? - I've never been imporessed with the Todd English restaruants in NYC - my husband swears his place in Boston is wonderful
The food was disgusting
The flavors did not blend well with one another
The fish, which I thought would be my favorite, was just nasty
The fish was drenched in a vinagrette sauce
Also, the fish was dry too
Service is pretty good, but the accoustics were bad
I couldn't have a normal dinner conversation with the people who sat across from me
I do not recommend coming here
the place was excellent, and best of all very accomodating
their vegetarian selection was very good and the server went out of her way to make sure i had enough to eat (checking in 4 or 5 times with new veggie dishes for me to try)
decor is trendy and fun
i will definitely go back
I'm so glad I was recommended this new, up and coming restaurant
For $40, my girlfirend and I ate and were treated like royalty
The antipasti covered a full range of Italian tastes and style
The pasta course were like soft pillows and the short ribs well
let's just say ahhhhhhh, ribs! Service was prompt and was willing to cater to all of my needs
My only complaint being that the sign on the front of the restaurant is hard to read
Todd English hits a home run, even if he is from Boston
I have been for the past few years in search of the citiy's best salumi board without getting ripped off
End I think I reached the summit
English is Italian, and damm sexy, makes the best home made testa in the city
You recieve (as part of the antipasti course) 7 different meats, and not just your bargin bin proscuitto
I ate so much food that I had visions of my Little Italy childhood
I can't wait to go back with a group of friends
The service tends to be alittle misdirected and the wonderful mozzeralla cart(high recommended) is to die for
First and foremost, we go to restaurants to eat, and this place comes up short
Maybe it was the first course's onion appetizer which was overwhelmed by Worcestershire sauce (YUCK!) that put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of it, but c'mon now, this is NYC, we can (and should) expect more
The other dishes were very mediocre other than the fried egg/asparagus/nut dish which was delicious
Otherwise, things were above average; the space is elegant and boasts a huge wine cellar mounted into the back wall which diners can see into
Also, the 2nd floor bar is a nice start to your night or perfect for meeting a friend coming in from nearby Grand Central Station
Great service and value with a unique idea, however since the food comes up short, I will not be returning
Wow - for the price, you would not believe what you get! Come hungry, as you will eat until you just have to stop
The food will keep coming until you tell the server to stop it
We particularly liked some things, and more of those items appeared without a second thought
This is an exceptional bargain for New York
But, please, do yourself a favor and save room for dessert
Our large party ordered most of the dessert items on the menu
They were beautifully presented, and were incredibly well done
The flavors were superb!!!
my husband and I went with two other couples, and everyone agreed - while the service was excellent and the atmosphere was great - the food was poor
the pizza at the bar was amazing, but sadly the dinner to follow was not
so if you must go, skip the dinner and just go for drinks and the free pizza upstairs
After having a delicious glas of Montepulciano at the bar with an attractive and chatty bartender, we headed down the stairs to the beautiful and airy dining room
The food started coming and never seemed to stop
Tasty cured meats followed crispy cod fritters and the portions were just right: just enough choices
finishing enjoyable dishes and yearning for a bit more of your favorites
The main courses were delightful, were prepared perfectly, and arrived with a pleasant punctuality
At no time were we rushed or hungry
great timing by the kitchen and waitstaff
Management made it a point to inquire about our experiences and I felt an odd familiarity with both the food and the employees
The night was capped by an overwhelming chocolate dessert of some kind (memory trouble here
I drank most of the wine) and an impromptu intro to Todd English himself
Nice guy, great restaurant
We went this past Sunday night
There were 10 of us and we sat at the large table in the middle with the lazy susan
We sat down and food started appearing until we said uncle
Great service, great food - highly recommended! and all for $39
The exceptionally high ceilings and wide upon spaces of this unexpectedly warm dinning arena inspire thoughts of gothic angels and religious verse
Certain that the cuisine could not live up to it's heavenly setting, I sat down with full intent of admiring the exceptional decor while nibbling on your basic New York Italian cuisine
However, upon first bite, I heard the angels sing
Tantalizing appetizers overwhelmed our table in an authentic display of rustic Italian cooking
With an obviious respect for hand picked quality ingredients the cooks at English is Italian manage to fill their Gothic space with heavenly cuisine making for a spiritual experience
Don't miss it
I attended a private party Happy 30 Jenny/ Spanasia Ballroom
What a wonderful time we had
The ambiance was wonderful, food excellent, service superb
If you are in Brooklyn, it is well worth the trip to Dumbo for this gem of a restaurant
WAS THERE FRIDAY NIGHT, WHAT GREAT ASIAN WAITRESS! SHE WAS HOT AND HAD A GREAT TIME
THE FOOD WAS GOOD AND SOME TAPAS WITH SOME DRINKS WITH MY FRIENDS
WE HAD A GOOD TIME AND IT DIDN'T COST US THAT MUCH
FOR THE PLACE IT WAS CHEAP
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO SPEND MORE
YOU CANNOT BELIVE THE DECOR OFTHE PLACE, IT IS SOMETHING YOU WOULD SEE IN DISNEY EPCOT PAVILIONS, VERY NICE GOOD JOB! I WILL BE BACK
My girlfriends and I were there on Saturday for the first time
We were impressed by the place
It was very nice and pleasent

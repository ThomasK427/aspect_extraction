Food is very good
Service is very good
Not too crowded and tables have a decent amount of space between
Casual atmosphere with fine cuisine
What's wrong with the people who don't like this place? It's a cozy little secret spot on the Upper East Side
I have been there several times and every time the food is delicious, the service is great, and the people seem like they are happy to have you come in
This is the kind of little place that's not trendy but it's very inviting and a pleasant place to eat
The fish soup with croutons and garlic mayo is wonderful and the skate is deliciouis
They will substitute sides for you on main dishes and are nice about it
The brunch has a couple of different options and is an excellent value
There may be a lot of older people dining in Sel et Poivre and that helps make it very homey and comfortable
My wife and I dined at Sel et Poivre last night
We also enjoy L'Absinthe, but were drawn to Sel et Poivre by the Carmelized Onion Goat Cheese Tart the Duck Magret
Both delicious! Drinks and desserts were also outstanding, as was the service
Highly recommended
This is by far the worst place that considers itself a restaurant I have ever eaten in my life
Yeah its cheap, but you pay for that in the lack of quality and flavor in the food
The chicken is simply a piece of roasted chicken you would expect at Boston Market with frozen french fires
I don't know why I went to this place
I was looking for a bargain and that is always when you get robbed--when you're trying to get something for nothing
The chocolate cake that I had was really really good, but it was more like deep chocolate Moroccon style cake than anything you would expect to find in France
I'm pretty sure that everything else is middle easten style French food here, too
If you want french food--spend a little more money and go somewhere else
I think the negative reviewer was in a different restaurant
When we dine at Sel Poivre, the owner or her daughter is there to greet us like old friends
We enjoy the ambience -- which is very much Paris bistro (without the pervading cigarette smoke)
The food makes me think I'm in Paris -- the chicken is always delicious -- I loved the cassoulet and expected to see the Champs Elysee out the window, not Lexington Ave
My husband gets either Steak frites -- yumm -- or the lamb and enjoys the experience
Our water glasses are rarely empty (a must for me) and the staff pays attention without being in your face
I cannot think of a better way to spend an evening than at Sel et Poivre, one of my favorite restaurants in New York City--it is like transporting yourself to Paris for the evening
Quaint, cozy, warm and romantic
I have always been greeted by a friendly hostess or host and given a table within a very short time
The food is delicious bistro fare from soups, salads, seafood and steak frites
Service is very professional, warm and helpful
This is just a nice place to be where you always feel at home with good food, lovely atmosphere and friendly people
FABULEUX!
Never would have guessed how the evening ended when I first walked in
Which is probably why I've been back so many times
Maybe it was because of the unpretentious surroundings that I was caught by surprise with the quality of French food served at this quaint French bistro
I happen to be a huge fan of everything from pates to skate fish to duck to steak frites
and this place does it all
the right way! To top if off, the wait staff is not only knowledgeable, but incredibly friendly
The biggest and most welcome shock of the night will come when you receive your check, which was much less than I expected to pay for such a wonderful meal
Would definitely recommend
Bon Appetite!!
Live in the neighborhood and tried this place one recent night


Service when we were first seated was very slow; took ten minutes to get drinks ordered
It speeded up, though, but after a decent salad, the main courses (roasted chicken and a fettucine with chicken in a pepper sauce) were marginal, at best
Nice enough place with reasonable prices but, don't expect gourmet food
In Short Friendly and welcoming, this restaurant serves one of the world's most ancient cuisines
The Persian menu offers a large number of cooling salads and homemade yogurt-based appetizers and a host of grilled meats in kebab form: lamb, filet mignon, chicken, chopped steak, even salmon
A selection of four different kinds of rice, including one made with sour cherries, provides an interesting counterpoint
The restaurant's calm, carpeted interior and courteous service help it stand out in a Second Avenue row of ethnic bistros
I eat out a lot! I come to Persepolis at least once a month and everytime I come, the food, service, ambience, drinks
everything is absolutely amazing
The owner and maitre 'd are extremely gracious and I love the fact that they remember what I drink! The servers take such excellent care of my parties and never stick their noses in at inappropriate moments
I love that they are so well-mannered
The food
honestly the kubideh is some of the best meat I've ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth
And the sour cherry rice? Brilliant
I can honestly say that the weight I've put on has been solely due to eating at this beautiful restaurant
It really is one of my favorite places to eat in this whole city!
Went their for dinner last night with my girlfriend
We got a nice bottle of Pinot Blanc $35
I would suggest ordering their appetizer sampler (for 2 or 4)Gives you two types of their exotic flavor rich salads (almost like relishes)and items like taboli, humus etc
etc
The appetizers were all so rich in flavor
I was alittle disappointed in the entrees
My girlfriend got the saffron chicken kabob
Some of the pieces were dry
I had this aged beef kabob
It just wasn't as flavorful as I would imagine
Don't go here expecting a rich sauce
Its kabobs and rice here
They offer four different types of rice
We both got Dill rice
it was fine
They did give us some free baklava at the end of our meal
So that was nice of them
Service was excellent thoughout the night
As soon as the food comes, there is a 10 minute silence at each table
I've never seen this at any other restaurant
Everything is delicious, the rice is drier than I'm used to but perfectly flavored
The lamb is incredibly prepared
And the desserts, especially the rose ice cream, are out of this world
The only failing was the persian tea, that I'm used to being sweetened with honey
The service is also great, they stayed open until my friend and I finished our meal, and, on another visit, took our tourist friends' bags into coat check
during the meal
Being from Persian descent this restaurants has one of the best kebobs I have ever eten
Unfortunately, the rice served is not the best example of Basmati rice
Ate a lot of Persian food growing up and this place nailed a lot of the staples
Service was extremely friendly and knowledgable, the bussers, runner, everyone eager to please but not obtrusively so
I would also stress the importance of trying their desserts (always a weak spot of Iranian cuisine I've encountered), they're imaginative and delicious
The prices are fair for the quality of the ingredients and the generous portions
I have to say that i'm italian and (of course) always skeptical about foreign food, especially when they combine sour cherries and rice
But a good soul is always ready for good food and that's how they make me feel, a good soul
Make sure you try the frozen vodka and eggplant appetizer
You're sure to start in the right direction for a fabulous meal that will make you feel like a sultan

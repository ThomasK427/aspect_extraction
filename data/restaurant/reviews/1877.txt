as in pequeno kernels, not the elote's from Veracruz
The only thing nice was the prize and skirt steak
Hostess told us 20 min
waited an hour
Not the end of the world
Food is pretty good but the service is horrific
Went with three people last saturday night - half way through our entrees we tried to order a second bottle of wine - both the hostess and waitress told us no, cause, ehh, the place is very crowded this night guys
I was dumbfounded
Our waitress asked us if we wanted anything else, we said only the check - she quickly scooped up our not-yet finished food
Curse you Cafe Habana, you give shame to the wonderful and friendly cubans
I love this place
So, you always have to wait
So what, its the size of a shoebox? Once you have that corn
mmmm
all is forgiven
And the food is consistantly great and the bills are consistantly small
But, last night was the first time I tried their mojito--Are you kidding me? They really call themselves a cuban restaurant and serve this? Tastes like watered-down Countrytime lemonade
Do yourself a favor and stick to beer
I mainly came for the corn
I'd heard about it from everyone, and, yes, it is that good (although smothered in butter -- guilt guilt guilt)! The cuban sandwich was also quite good
We got a table pretty quickly, but we also made sure to get there early since this place is always packed
The seating was very awkward as our table was squished between two other tables, and when I wanted to get up to use the bathroom, it was somewhat of an ordeal to get out
The waitress was too hipster to ever crack a smile and didn't seem to care if/when we ordered/paid
The meal was a pretty good value though and the people-watching there was great
This is where you go on a Saturday night when you crave Latin America
The music is always hot, the corn, always perfect
Small dishes, a bit pricier than you'd pay in Miami or LA, but the atomsphere is on the sexy side (however pared down) and its cozy
You cant go wrong with any of the dishes here
The wine list is good as well
This place is very small and crowded, with a definite greasy spoon feel
The appetizers are really good - in particular the roasted corn and the corn patty
I made the mistake of going with sauteed grouper thinking they might turn out something very exiciting, but it was completely average
My friend got the steak enchiladas which were delicious
I've been here a dozen times cuz their Cuban sandwich might be the best ever
However, the attitude and competence of their staff is SOHO/NOLITA at its absolute worst
Who do these jokers think they are?! This is particularly true at their takeout branch next door
Sullen and careless, it's like they're doing you a favor
I get enuf of garbage like that in NYC
I'll be darned if I'll actually pay for it!! Hasta luego!
Cute place, but the food is rather bland
If you want authetic Cuban go elsewhere
If all you care about is looking cute and looking cool, or you want to people watch then this is the place for you
we sometimes get takeout for lunch from this place
the corn and chicken salad is REALLY good and so is the steamed spinach with garlic
as well as the corn with lime juice and paprika
i would just get the food to go so you can enjoy without the wait or the wait staff snooty-ness
kinda snooty over the phone too
If I had gotten the pulled pork, rice and beans for $4 from a lunch truck, I might have been perfectly satisfied with my meal
however at a hefty $9 at Cafe Habana, I expected a little more than I got
It was pretty tastless (I guess they expect you to season it yourself with the bottle of Tabasco on the table) and definitely overpriced for what it was! Also, the service was pretty bad, which usually doesn't matter to me if the food is good, but that was not the case
Cafe Habana's food is exactely like a very good home cooked meal
my mouth waters everytime I think about the corn, then the black beans, then the red beans, the salad, the skirt steak
it is the best to have it as the neighboor!
Skip the boring old pancakes and omlettes and come here for brunch
Great huevos rancheros and the best vegetarian Cuban sandwich in New York - Torta con queso blanco - white cheese, black beans, and avocado! Delicious curly fries! This place is tiny and crowded, expect a wait
And no air conditioning in the summer
Feels like you really are in Cuba! But the food is worth it
This restaurant offers the worst service I have ever experienced in my four years of living in NY
I don't care how super their corn is
It will not compensate for the excessively rude hostess and the 2 hour wait (when you call they will tell you 20 minutes)
The grilled corn on a cob with chili powder and lime is to die for!! One long weekend in New York, we went there daily for this corn
Even when we weren't hungry we had it as a snack!  If you can, sit at the counter - just watching the bartender work is a treat in itself
everytime i go to nyc, i always make sure to stop by cafe habana
i love their grilled corn with parmesan and paprika as well as their grilled pork, black beans and rice
reasonably priced and very yummy
Cafe Habana is one of my favorites! The food is wonderful (especially the grilled corn and pollo mirador), the staff nice and the price amazing! It gets SUPER crowded, and they don't take reservations, so show up early or make sure you don't mind the wait - it's worth it!
This cozy little place on the corner of Prince and Elizabeth is one of my favorite spots in Manhattan
It's also one of the reasons that I'm sad I don't live there anymore
The place is a little small, so Id' recommend getting there early for lunch and dinner
Otherwise, you might not get a seat
The Pollo Mirador, (chicken in garlic sauce with spinach) is simply amazing
Very tasy
As an appetizer, you have to get the grilled corn on the cob
Lots of stars and fabulous people
But the best part is the food and Nolita atmosphere
The service in the restaurant is always so slow and sometimes even unfriendly
All they need to do is to pop over to your table to let you know the status of your order is so you don't get mad when people seated, and who ordered, after you get their food first
But no, they pretty much ignore the customers and sometimes just stand around gossiping
If poor service is a turn-off for you too, might as well just get your food from the take-out section next-door
They ignore you just the same, but you don't feel obligated to leave a small tip if they're mean
I tell you though, you'll probably get hooked on that corn and keep coming back despite the bad treatment
Just like a dog
Woof!
Take out from the window next door is probably the best way to enjoy the food here
The food is so good; the service is so bad
The wait is understandable, but who can explain waitresses that forget orders 2 out of 3 times and are oh so rude about it?
This is my favorite restaurant in New York
The menu features fresh meats and vegetables in mouth watering combinations
The grilled corn is a favorite among everyone, but I've yet to try anything I don't like there from the cuban sandwich, grilled chicken and corn salad and chorizo breakfast burrito
Every friend I have brought here agrees its worth the wait, since there always is one
Get the cuban sandwich and the corn
Excellent food
Nice service
One of my favorite places in NYC
Food is delicious and the service is good, if you behave yourself and don't mind the wait
Unfortunately Wannabes constantly saving the world on their cellphones learned about the place and the wait is longer than what it used to
Don't go Thursday-Saturday, if you don't want to wait around 45 minutes
What to eat? Get corn, plantanes, cheeseburger, and the spinach
For brunch, eggs with chorizo is highly recommended
If you're coming here for the scene, you're missing the point -- the FOOD is fantastic

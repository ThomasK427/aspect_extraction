We had such a horrible time
The decor is gorgeous
Our waitress--Christina--was soo nice, even the coat check lady was great
Desserts were fabulous, the collard greens
I thought I wanted to die
The salomon is okay and the honey fried chicken is mouth-watering (I am from the south, and this was the really thing
)  And the tall, lean guy hanging around? Yes, you recognize from the Five HeartBeats (He is the owner's son)
I really enjoyed this place
Not only was the food great but the staff as well, that's rare in New York!
We were a party of 12
Some liked their entrees, others didn't
All agreed the sides were spicy
I like that! Cannot beat the ambience and decor
Fabulous! Drinks were good too
I agree that the presentation could have been better
Did not get to dessert as it took a while to get the server's attention and we had a show to get to
Very busy place
I would recommend and would go back
Just don't expect to be blown away by food
The server was very rude
He failed to check on my party after we received our food
When we finally were able to get his attention, he failed to followup on our request
We were never asked if we wanted dessert or coffee
The food was terrible
When the food arrived, it was lukewarm and not very flavorful
The quality of the food along with the poor service does not warrant the steep prices
Last, my husband called in our reservation
However when we arrived, we were told that our reservation was not listed and as a result, we had to wait
If you're in New York City, Jezebel's should not be on your list as a must see
Everything was fabulous, from the decor (porch swings, comfy living room chairs, and lots of pillows) to grub (outstanding she-crab soup, amazing grits and mashed potatoes, and the best okra I've ever had)
The owner is very sweet and very southern!! The prices are a little high, but don't let that stop you from visiting
it's well worth it!
I totally loved this place!! The food was very good and the service was more than adequate! The owner made it a point to greet us and spend a few minutes at our table chatting---which was a very nice gesture
The southern decor was enchanting, as was the cuisine
Would I go back again? In a heartbeat! I will make sure that I place Jezebel's on my to eat at list everytime I find myself in NY!
Recently I went to Jezebel with a party of 28 at 11:00 PM when a reservation at another restaurant fell through last minute
We were sent there since their kitchen is open until midnight
THe moment we walked in, my anger with the whole situation melted away
It was such a beautiful restaurant visually, smelled wonderful, so I knew the food would be great, they had a live piano player
Then, we were greeted by the owner, Alberta, who was very warm and welcoming
Soon we sat down to a wonderful, gourmet Southen meal
When most of the other customers had left and the piano player had finished, they started palying some great dance music and we were all soon up dancing away with everyone, including Alberta and we had a magical evening which we could never have planned
i highly recommend this restaurant
i found it to be one that people of statue go to and that the owner is an excellent hostess
She is extremely warm and friendly
All of the help was quite professional in their service
Looking forward to dinning there again when i am in New York
Bad experience - Jezebel, the owner, brought a cat to her restaurant and it had escaped and was running through the back of the dining room
We were appauled as Jezebel and other patrons were on their hands and knees looking for the cat
But had finished our dinner and politely told our waiter  we would take our check at the bar
Jezebel came over to us and, nastily, refuted the cat being in the room for more than 5 seconds - contrary to the customer is always right attitude most restaurants adhere to and paid for our dinner thinking that we would be satisfied and return
After being nasty to us about the incident and making a bigger deal than we were and making us feel extremely uncomfortable, we left
Even before the incident, the food was not worth the price tag, go somewhere else
Great food, worth your money
Good for special occasions like birthdays and graduations!
This place reminded me of going down south on a family vacation
The atmosphere was great and romantic
The bathrooms at Jezebel's are about the best I have seen in the City, it feels like you are at your auntie's house - clean
The food was good, however they were out of the oxtails and whitings
I had the chicken and waffles and it was tasty
However the presentation of the food could have been better for the price
It was enough but it wasn't pretty and done up
The fact that this restaurant has been around so long they must be doing something to please the customers
I love the atmosphere, especially the linens in the bathrooms, the expensive food and most of
the MaryJanes at the door!
Soul food with a French twist is good but not worth the prices this restaurant charges
Sweet potatoes will always be sweet potatoes no matter how French you want to make it
What makes you think you are eating well is the romantic decor and the high prices
Restaurant was a different experience but not worth the $$
The food was pretty good, but I couldn't really enjoy it because Jezebel's tries to hard and it shows
Jezebel's metaphor: The restaurant is a person who sports label-drenched clothing (e
g
, Prada, Gucci, LV) and accessories to make people think they are more than they really are
How ridiculous is it to have two forms of payment in this day and age?: AMEX and cash!Anyone in the service industry (and I am not), well anyone with common sense knows that this will surely turn away customers
Probably won't go back
Ok
The staff has a stuck-up attitude, it's expensive, and they don't take credit cards on a dinner for two that easily runs you at least $100
HOWEVER
The food is delicious (I have lived for years in the south and I think this food is quite tasty) and the atmosphere is exceptional
I can't think of a sexier place to take a date for a dinner for two, from the porch swing table seating to the fancy 1920's flapper dress decorations
Go there
Expect to spend
But atmosphere is really what a romantic dinner is all about
Jezebel was recommended for brunch on Mothers Day
The hostess did not verify/review the menu prices with us nor did they inform us of the logistics of the brunch
With it being a brunch, one would think its all you can eat
My party of three proceeded to fix our plates and the owner mumbled over the guests ears, you better fill up, cause its one plate per person, how unprofessional
My table had four plates and three guests, the owner had the nerve to inquire if there was another person sitting at my table
She argued with me that I would be charged for the additional plate
How rude!! The owner played favorites with which table she would acknowledge
Of course, she overlooked my table
I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, its overpriced and customer service is not a priority

In Short The strictly vegetarian dishes at these temples of New Age Asian cuisine are so good they'll almost make you a believer in tofu--the basil moo shu rolls are a fairly religious experience by themselves
You can relax amid the postmodern Buddhist serenity of the dining rooms, but busy New Yorkers generally find a bite at the counter just as fulfilling
I thought this place was too good to be true
With all the good reviews, I figured the food wouldn't live up to the hype, or it would be out of my price range
I got the veggie sandwich for $4
50 (!!!) and it was so filling that I only ate half of it
The food was delicious, and there's so many choices that I just might come back again and again

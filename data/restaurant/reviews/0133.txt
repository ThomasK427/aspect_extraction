No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates
Stay far away from this place
The Scene This charming cafe, packed in along a crowded stretch of Eighth Avenue, serves excellent renditions of both sweet and savory crepes
The interior features a curious spatial inversion, with a lamppost, cobblestone floor and murals that are intended to evoke the outdoor seating at a Parisian cafe
The Food A highlight among the sweet crepes is one that brings together fresh blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in an oozing, fat-free vanilla cream, while a strong choice among the savory buckwheat-wrapped crepes couples a white bean and garlic paste with fiery merguez sausage
If it's nice out, order a glass of red wine and consume your crepe at one of the tables near the cafe's open front--there are far worse ways to whittle away a warm spring afternoon in the city
I came in for lunch a couple of weeks ago and had such a great experience that I had to bring my husband in
He was impressed by the quality of service and food
We spoke to the manager Pat who was great
The servers seemed to be well trained, we complimented him on his staff and he told me that he had been working with them everyday since he started with Rue a couple of months ago
Great job, THANK YOU!
Had a great meal there this weekend before heading to the movies! It had been awhile and I forgot just how delicious crepes can be
We went there looking for a nice brunch place after reading the reviews, seeing the high rating and viewing the fancy website
We had the most substandard crepes after waiting to order for about 15 min at off peak brunch hour
Similarly had to go to the cashier to pay, tired of waiting
The food is nothing special, don't waste your money
Luckily there was a street fair near so could get some crepes there to satisfy our craving
I went to Rue des Crepes with a couple of friends one night for dinner
The place looks very nice, a bit on the small side
The service was great
Waiters constantly kept refilling our water
Their menu selection is good and well priced
It's a good place to try crepes
a different eating experience
Most of the food choices come in crepes (ex: chicken and vegetables rolled in a crepes)
Taste wise, there didn't seem to be anything too special
I also ordered a dessert: icecream with fruit, but they put the icecream in the crepe and it was completely melted, so much for eating my icecream
We also all shared a big pot of fries (they are served in a flower pot)
This is a good place to come with friends or with romantic partner for decent priced food
Crepes? In New York? Decently made? Yup, it's true
Sooooo good, you should definately try this place
Sweet, salty, they have it all
Head out there and try one
You know you want to
PS- The decor is beyond cute
I have been to this place a total of 3 times now and their crepes are definitely good
However, the service here has been consitently poor
Don't get me wrong, the servers seem very nice and sweet but I don't think management here has trained them to be exceptionally catering to the customers
All three times I've been here, I've had a different server take my order and everytime, I had to look for them and ask them to refill my water
And it's not even busy
I'll see my waiter standing behind the counter just gazing at the ceiling
And another downside to this place is the seats are uncomfortable
Although the service is aloof, they seem genuinely nice and not at all snooty
So all in all, I would recommend this place because their crepes ARE very good and it'd def
worth it
I've been searching for somewhere in NYC that does justice to the crepes I've had in Paris
And I'm not talking desert crepes, I'm talking about crepes you would have as an entree
something you would order as a quick dinner in Paris
Well, I've found it at Rue des Crepes
On top of this, they have some wonderful dipping sauces for their frites (french fries) as well as the traditional french baguette sandwiches -- I've been searching for these as well and will try soon!
Went with a date for a leisurely brunch
Service was spectacular
The mixed berry sweet crepe was light and delicious, just the right amount of sweetness
F/fries were crisp with a subtle dipping sauce
Spinach quiche was creamy with a flaky crepe crust
My highest recommendation for a place to relax and enjoy each other's company
These are the best crepes (outside of Paris) that I've had
Definitely beats Crepes to Go in the west village
They have dessert and dinner/lunch crepes
The nutella and banana is my favorite - not too sweet like the place in the West Village
Definitely try it out
The prices are decent, although not as cheap as if you ate crepes in Paris(they're approximately 1
50 - 5 euros in Paris)
Unfortunately, it's kind of hard to get to if you live on Union Square since it's all the way on the west side
I ate here with 3 other people in December
The service here is excellent, the food is good, and the place has a nice, comfortable, coffee-house vibe; it's the kinda place you could spend a couple hours hanging out enjoying drinks and dessert after your meal
The desserts are especially good
And to top it all off, this place has the nicest smelling bathroom I've ever been in before! Their potpourri and candles are magical
This place was super good! I'm not a huge fan of crepes, but these were really good: buckwheat crepes! Get the bucket of frites
They are thin, crispy and nice and salty
Try the steak and cheese and onion crepe or the ham and cheese crepe
Both of those were super good
Dessert is just as excellent
The staff was super friendly as well
The atmosphere is more of a coffee shop, so you can stop in anytime
It's pretty empty during the week at lunch time, but they have specials as well
A must try!
Excellent food
We try to get down there as much as we can
Best crepes I had in NYC
Quick seat yourself service
Crepes are very fresh and tastes great
Authentic French style
Dessert crepes are a real treat
Their savory crepes are great; I recommend the herb chicken crepe with great grilled chicken and roasted peppers to die for
Always keep me coming back for more
First off, Opa does not try to be anything that it's not
If you want a lot of good food, go to Opa
If you don't care about the wait staff as long as they bring you your drinks and dinner, then go to Opa
If you want to only pay $10-$15 for a huge meal, then go to Opa
I think the food is delicious, and you get what you pay for
The platters are where you get your $ worth, so stick to them
But if you just get a gyro, for about $5, that will more than fill you up
It's not glamerous, and yes there are many more nicer Greek places to eat, but you will pay more
Opa is worth every penny
I went into Opa last week even after reading some of the negative reviews
A friend told me the food was very good
I got about five feet into the place when I realized that I might have made a mistake
My friend and I had been standing by the door for about 15 seconds, waiting to be seated, when a heavyset, older man (working behind the counter)very sarcastically asked me if we were going to stand there all day or sit down
Just then, a woman (looking very embarrased) came to us and proceeded to find us a table

Shrimp Etouffee, Jambalaya etc
We even ordered crawfish and David (Dad!) sat and cracked them open for us squemish girls
LOL
All I can say is Kudos to David, Becka and ofcourse Mara
They bring a whole new meaning to what dining out is about
I just returned home from this great family-owned kitchen that acts as a restaurant
Let me tell you
this place was awesome
The food definately had that homemade taste
The meatloaf is great and is individually made, no slices here! My girlfriend had the catfish, also spectacular
The bananas foster is just like you would get in New Orleans (I am told the recipe came from a famous NO restaurant)
The family is very friendly and earger to give you samples of some of their other selections
I am looking forward to going back and trying the other selections on the menu!
My experience at Mara's was one of the best I've had in New York
From the individualized menu that greeted me by name, to the amazing comfort food (best fried chicken I've had north of the mason-dixon!) to the overwhelming friendliness of the owners, to the unbelievable value (four courses for two people, under $50!!), I didn't know a place like this could exist in the city but I'm so thrilled I found it
This restaurant is ideal for a date, a family, a group of friends, any displaced southerner or anyone who ever craves a little homestyle comfort in this cold city
I plan to tell everyone I know to eat here as often as possible - you could certainly afford to!
looking for good american home cooking, friendly service and jazz- try CURRY ROW! seriously though, we took some out-of-town guests here for brunch and had a fabulous time (and its hard to find a place that will take 11!)
the food was excellent (the chocolate chip scones are a MUST) and the service made us feel like we were regulars
rave reviews in our group were had for the salmon BLT and the gargantuan french toast
the unusual location worries us that passers-by wont stop in and indulge but, on second thought, we dont mind keeping this secret to ourselves!!!
Recently I have had the pleasure of experiencing Mara's Homemade restaurant
And found the place warm and comfortable
If felt as if I were eating at a familys home
The food portions were full and delicious
For the Thanksgiving Holiday I enjoyed pumpkin soup and turkey with all of the trimmings
Also I stopped in for brunch, which included homemade honey butter and large portion of french toast with hot syrup
All cooked by Mara herself
Her family adds to the special atmosphere, along with some great sounds of jazz accompanied by a live band
So if there is no where to go and your feeling alone
Just stop into Mara's Homemade and you will be right at home, in the heart of the east village
Why wait in ridiculous lines around the city when you can enjoy an amazing brunch with homemade muffins and scones right out of the oven! Plus, they have a wonderful live jazz band
This new restaurant is still one of New York's best kept secrets, but I'm sure it won't stay that way for long
I have to come back every weekend because it's so yummy!
I loved this restaurant so much I am actually planning my company Christmas Party there
The food is great American Standard comfort food
And Mara is the sweetest Mom you'll ever want to have making your dinner
Everything she makes is tasty and familiar
Don't miss the crab fingers, layered dip, tomato soup and my personal favorite - chocolate cream pie
Also - don't miss the rotating art showing
I had a great time there for the last few weeks since Mara opened  her new place
Just like Java n Jazz, only better!!! They make  great homemade food, like their New Orleans shrimp scampi for dinner or the Eggs Benedict with Canadian bacon and eggs
The owners were helpful and friendly, just like your Mom's  home cooking
Just be sure to enjoy it too!!!
If you are in the mood for some good old fashioned Comfort food Mara's Homemade is the place to go! I had their cranberry chicken and homemade mashed potatoes and they were to die for!! Plus the Bluegrass Pie is the most amazing thing you will ever taste
Had a very nice dinner late on a Wed
night
My group' s steaks were prepared perfectly and the special shrimp app was excellent
The manager stopped by and offered an after dinner wine with compliments
My only complaint was the lack of music in the back dining room but otherwise the evening was a very nice suprise
I will return for the Prix Fix for sure
The Scene The ever-popular brasserie look--white tiled walls, gleaming dark-wood banquettes padded with caramel leather--gets Italian touches in the form of a wood-burning pizza oven, decorative rows of Cinzano bottles and brightly labeled canned tomatoes
It's just evocative enough to convince that its wraparound terraces will offer a view more alluring than Ninth Avenue
The Food The Italian menu offers inventive touches
Appetizer standouts include a trio of smoky grilled sardines and a silky plate of ruby carpaccio showered with bits of black truffle and Parmesan
An almost flaky-crusted pizza features dabs of creamy robiola cheese and a whiff of white-truffle oil, and succulent lamb shank nestles into creamy polenta and greens in a deep earthenware bowl
Only a couple of dishes fall short: The rather dry homemade ravioli needs more butternut squash stuffing, and chocolate torta is just an ooze of hot batter in a thin chocolate skin
the ambience for the outdoor seating in 90 degree weather was terrific
it's a terrace seating and you can't go wrong with this choice as far as ambience is concerned
Food was alright while service was not good
Our waitress forgot to bring our bread out and never bothered to check up on us after the meal was delivered hence it took forever to get additional stuff since there was noone to ask
the food was average and coming from San Francisco italian food there is terrific
The next day in little italy i realized how charming and yummy some of the food was and had wished we had skipped Bortega
But it's good if you want to check out Hiro downstairs and the rooftop bar Cabanas upstairs, both of which we couldn't as we were rushing to check out the night view from Empire state bldg
The outside seating is lovely and the menu looked great
The waiter was unpleasant from the start
He brought out salads with entrees and then gave us a dirty look after we flagged down another server (as he did not come back to the table once to check on things) to take our cold pasta back to get reheated
At the same time on friends entree did not come out at all
When hers finally did come out we were still waiting for the cold pasta to come back from the kitchen
He was very rude and made what could have been a great meal very unpleasant
I had figured a place with such a good reputation would want to know about it when bad service was taking place
I called the general manager twice with no response
guess I was wrong
I enjoyed the most delicious meal here recently under the umbrellas in the outdoor dining area
I dined with a friend who lived in Italy for a while, and he commented that it was some of the most authentic - and tasty! - Italian food he's had since returning to the city
It's a great place to enjoy a warm summer night, and grab something to eat before heading to the Cabanas upstairs for cocktails and dancing!
I went to La Bottega after work for drinks on a Thurs nite and had a great time
The bartender, Nicole, is top-notch
She not only mixes a fine Lychee martini, but is just a cool chick
I stayed for another (amazing) French martini and sat at the bar with my friends
Yes, the drinks are a tad pricey, but I had top shelf martinis and this is nyc
so no complaints
The outdoor space is very cool with the little umbrella'd tables
a nice warm break in the summertime from the a/c
my friend and I were able to hop in and out from the bar to the patio drinks-in-hand, no problem
I'll definitely be back to sample the food
the pizza smelled deelish
Everything my friend and I ate was delicious and perfectly seasoned
The branzino was super fresh
The chicken under the brick was simply wonderful
Delicious soup and carpaccio
Desserts were also nice, but could use a more fancy dress
The service was more than adequate
Grace was a stellar server
The drinks could be better with some better garnishes
The prices are very fair given it's neighborhood
P
S
The patio is a beautiful space to sit and enjoy the company of friends at a leisurely pace that is very inviting
Chef Chris D'Amico gets kudos for making sure that the food come at a pace that doesn't make you feel harried in a place that is rocking busy on most nights

The white tuna is EXCELLENT and I just really like their food and wouldn't hesistate to recommend! Enjoy!
My friends and I went at HARU on a Tuesday evening, so it was not very busy
But despite that our dinner took far too long to be served
Everyone in my group ordered Sushi/Sashimi entrees and it was at least 45 minutes before we got our food
To make things worse, they served 3 of the 4 entrees first so the poor forth guy had to wait even longer
When the food all finally came, it was yet another disappointment
The Sashimi Deluxe, surely was not deluxe
the pieces were small and few
Totally unsatisfying
I will not be returning to HARU again!
Haru on the Upper West Side is awesome
the sushi is so fresh
they also happen the have the best teriaki chicken i've ever had
the chicken is amazing
their salads are great too
love the house dressing
Sit at the sushi bar to avoid the long wait and watch the chefs make their magic
Some of the special rolls are not aptly named, i
e
the Wasabi Roll should be renamed the Christmas Roll as it has green and red colored caviar and not much wasabi at all
The lettuce in the house salad is sometimes wilted, but dressing is excellent
The Sushi is top-notch for the value
nothing much to write home about, but haru serves up a consistent and good japanese meal
i had the chirashi and my friends had assorted plates with sushi and sashimi
overall, the fish was fresh
would recommend this place if you need a japanese food fix
it's decent and a good value
Incredibly fresh and flavorful sushi; soothing ambience and saki that will knock your socks off!
Excellent fusion of savory sushi with different sauces, toppings, complements
Makes for an excellent new tasty sensation!  Only problem
you eat *SO* much
it can get a tad pricey
Some travel books bill this as a French restaurant
wouldn't call it French, but the food is excellent
Unfortunately we had to rush through our meal to make it a show
The service left a little to be desired
Not sure if it was just a language barrier or if our server was really that bad
Overall we would both recommend
Savann rejected a gift certificate I had to the restaurant because they no longer take those anymore
BUT they took my money for it
Very not classy and very snotty in its rejection
I will not try to go here again
The Sunday brunch menu has your typical Upper West Side selections
I ordered the Steak and Eggs and although the steak was extremely tasty it was quite skimpy
The eggs were also scrambled perfectly but they were sparse
The make the plate seem full by adding a slice of watermelon and some lettuce
Fill up on the bread and muffins
Service is typical of a French type restaurant, so-so
What a let down, since this place is rated well here and in Zagat
It was the worst service ever- rude, surly and inattentive waiter- and the worst food
Everything was over-cooked and dry
Awful- go elsewhere
We had a lovely dinner at Savann last night
The spinach salad was delicious, unusual, and just the right size, as were the crab cakes
My friends were all very pleased with their dinners, and we had a nice, reasonably priced bottle of wine
The tarte tatin for dessert was fabulous
All in all, a truly delightful place with very reasonable prices
If this gem were a block east, on Columbus Ave
, I have no doubt it would be packed all day every day
Since it isn't, my wife and I had no trouble getting a table at an early dinner, and we're so glad we did: the fried clam appetizer was beautiful (believe me!) and scrumptious, and my entre (a purse of seafood) was almost too beautiful to eat -- but it was wonderful, as was my wife's dish
We had to try dessert, and the Tarte Tatin with cinnamon ice cream and honey was perfect
Attentive, friendly, service, too
Complimentary port didn't hurt at all
We'll be back
If you're seeking a restaurant where you will enjoy a relaxing afternoon or evening with very tasty food and remarkably attentive but unobtrusive service, you won't find a nicer place than Savann
We've recently had brunch and dinner there, both delicious; accompanied by good, reasonably priced wine
Recently, I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant - it was a brunch for 60 people, all of whom said the food was exceptional
The owner is a a charming gentleman who takes a personal interest in his customers and makes everyone feel at home
All in all, a splendid venue in a neigborhood that is overloaded with noisy, expensive restaurants that seldom deliver real value
REALLY, REALLY GREAT food
Excellent meal, beautiful presentaion, prices are totally reasonable
A way-better than average neighborhood joint
When I visited they offered a $17
95 prix-fixe menu that looked great
I ordered lobster, scallops and shrimp in a filo purse that was awesome
My salmon gravlox and caviar app was great too
In Short The dining room at Silk Road Palace is simple--a single square chamber with brick walls, rose-colored tablecloths and few decorations
Most of the restaurant's West Side regulars take advantage of the free delivery, but the dining room is usually full as well
The menu offers favorites from all over China: mellow Lake Tung-Ting shrimp from Hunan; peppery Sichuan tofu with minced pork; and Shanghainese soups with pickled mustard greens
My wife and I came on a Saturday night and ended up waiting over an hour for a table as loud college kids did their best to make their conversations open to all in a radius if 100 yard
The food was abundant and good but wasn't worth the unpleasant wait
Ok, so the wine is from a box, but it's actually not bad for cheap wine
The service is great! The people are wonderful
And, the food is some of the best American-Chinese I have found anywhere
All for a great value, you can't beat it
My godparents have been taking me to this restaurant for years, and now that I am of drinking age I can really enjoy it
I recommend the spare ribs with black bean sauce
This was a fun place to go
Wine in abundance, generous servings of food and a college buzz which makes this a cheap but worthwhile visit
Groups are big- which makes it slightly harder to get a table, but for a happy couple looking for great food and an intoxicating night out - cheap but cheerful (and quality food)- this is the place!
Has anyone ever been to Chinatown? I always see the lines out the door at the Silk Road so I decided to finally give it a try, but I was terribly disappointed
The free wine was from a box
The food was of the same quality as the take-out places in my neighborhood
The one bright star was the friendly wait staff
Nevertheless, I really don't understand the hype over this place
Save your money and try another Chinese restaurant
Visited for the first time Friday night with my boyfriend
I really couldn't believe the free wine talked about in all the reviews, so I went to see for myself
It was true
And it was great

coconut, walnut, chocolate, mango, vanilla, cinnamon
Some too sweet, they should stick to a less sugary, natural, subtle flavor
At $4
50 a bowl, it's a little much for me to go often
I'm hoping they come out with smaller portions, or a way to split the bowl into two flavors
That way I can go and have a nibble more often, for less money!
The Scene With Victorian-chintz wallpaper, stained-glass windows and mix-and-match china, this osteria looks like countless other shabby-chic and cheap Italian joints--only this one's in Prospect Heights, and owner Albano Ballerini sure is glad you came
When he's not slicing prosciutto behind the food-draped service bar, he's making the rounds with gratis tastes of wine from his native Marche region
The Food The small menu is designed for sipping wine, socializing and heavy snacking, with excellent cured meat-and-cheese plates laced with wine-soaked figs
Make meals of well-crafted antipasti, like freshly marinated white anchovies, sweet-sour cipollini onions and spicy eggplant
The few entrees change daily, but they're pre-cooked and relatively pricey--stuffed chicken breast and simple stewed squid are on heavy rotation
Parmesan-crisped risotto casseroles are well-seasoned comforts--hope for the mortadella-studded variety
This was a unique experience with some fresh, mouth-pleasing fare (savory flan, white anchovies, cheeses and breads), but we found the service neglectful and bordering on unfriendly
It's a mellow Italian-ish hang-out that's good for atmosphere, a few bites to eat, and a good wine list
The pasta dish we had was only average
put it this way, while eating, a cockr@ach crawled on our table to join us
when we aleted the owner, he didnt apologize or anything just brushed it off and that was all
was pretty much in disbelief, not at the r@ach but the arrogance of the owner
no apolgy, no nothing
the owner is just like the restaurant a real loser! -fyi citysearch does not allow, in your review, to type in r@ach!!
first is the decor, perfectly simple and appropriate to the fare
second is the staff, Owner Albano was into it working on hosting the evening and setting the president and with the attentiveness of Andrea who really knows his wine and how to make a customer feel welcome they make a powerful pair
We visited during dine in Brooklyn week and now have another new favorite spot in the neighborhood
The fig roll, the grilled fennel, the pork shoulder, the artichoke/mushroom lasagna, the seafood soup, the BREAD!!!, the orange cured olivesall wonderful
rarely do you have a dining experience so complete
for dessert we had the cheese plate and the panna cotta accompanied by 2 select dessert wines that Andrea recommended and was spot on again
To wrap
go to italy, eat and drink
come back and go here
then you'll really get it
This is a nice small neighborhood restaurant that is stuck in its ways
What a pleasure it was when it first opened! Very cozy if almost but not quite cramped
Slightly overpriced but one was willing to pay for the ambiance and intersting tastes
However, the menu is very short and the choices have hardly changed since opening several years ago
The appetizers are generally overpriced as is much of the wine
Still it is a very pleasant place to drop in
i wanted very much to like this neighborhood restaurant, but was extraordinarily disappointed
the food was rather uninspired, and the service, pushy
dishes were simply entirely too dull and questionably executed to justify the price
Attention to details, excellent wines, bites of old memories: that's what I found in this cute, little place
You don't want to go there just to eat, but to indulge in a truly Italian experience!
Beautiful cozy place to come to on a chilly night
I felt I was invited to the home of a family -- a young girl answered the door and led us to our table
The dishes are simple but elegant
I had the tasting menu, which was a bargain at $35
Others tried smaller dishes on the menu
Highlights were the vast wine selection, the wine-soaked figs and cheese selection, the lamb (tender with subtle tastes of rosemary)
The service was fairly attentive
We were a party of five celebrating a birthday on a Sunday night, and we felt no need to rush
We even received a complimentary bottle of Braccetto D'Acqui! Bravo!
I expected to love this place, but came away amazed that people think they can actually run a successful restaurant like this
The entrees consisted of sliced meat with cheese and fruit, in appetizer portions at outrageous prices
A small plate of salami, cheese and figs costs $16
50! The prosciuto was sliced so thickly it was like chewing a raw raw meat- practically inedible
The closest thing they had to a real meal was leg of lamb, which consisted of a plate the size of a bread plate with sliced re-heated lamb pieces - no vegetable, so sides, no sauce, for $14
50
With two tables of people eating and three waitresses, the service was still awful
Someone needs to clue these people in that you need to actually serve more than snacks (or at least charge snack prices) if you want to be considered a real restaurant
A small treausure was born recently on this rather dead block of Vanderbilt
This is a tiny, but comfortable, place filled with big flavors
The night we visited, there was no main course, but instead a selection of small plates was offered
We had a plate of smoked meats, some stinky cheeses (that's how they were described on the menu), delicious marinated anchovies, and crostini with various vegetable toppings
Accompanied by the house Sangiovese, this was a surprisingly pleasant evening out in Prospect Heights
My new favorite and I have tried them all downtown
Just awesome across the board- zero attitude, great service- AMAZING sushi AND prepared food, creative, unique rolls, hefty portions- not cheap, but absolutely worth it
Always fresh and delicious- I have never been let down and eaten here at least 100 times
Great location- go early and windowshop, or visit ciao bella for dessert
I recommend the Jason, Red Dragon, Mexican, Black Pepper, Valentine rolls
The spicy tuna bowl, garlic shrimp, any dunpling- apprtizers are all great!
I just went here last night and its a nice little restaurant tucked away where no one will find you
The food was fresh (esp
the tuna) and the staff and owner were tremendously friendly, courteous and on their toes! Shockingly the restroom was clean too! I would recommend this place
Phenomenol!!! The fish melted in my mouth
We had a dish with gold in it!! No Joke, really!! The service was good, everything was well seasoned
After living 4 years in Asia, this still ranks as some of the best sushi ever!!!
A visit to Kiva Cafe is a lucious experience
This small restaurant is a jewel of a place
You can give in to the tempation and indulge yourself in the delicious food, or just sit back and enjoy the warm ambiance and the jazzy music
Then there are the ceramics
What are you doing in New York in 2003 if you have not experienced the joy of Kiva Cafe?
I've been to the cafe a few times
It's full of light, warmth and quite energy
The display of ceramics art work is lovely, as well as coffee, tea and everything on the menu
The Scene Fifth Avenue is newly flooded with lunchtime options, and peckish Slopers won't find a more charming option than this
Parisian bistro chic meets countryside kitsch in the buttery-walled bar and dining room, decked with signature ceramic mustard and spice jars
As sunbeams pouring through the large windows give way to soft sconce lights, the laid-back afternoon crowd yields to a sexier scene
The Food The restaurant's menu features artfully rethought bistro classics
Namesake mustard adds textured zest to the perfect gruyere-smothered croque monsieur and light, flavorsome body to the house vinaigrette
Dinnertime highlights include luscious tuna and salmon tartare kissed with creme fraiche, caviar and hints of mustard oil
A potato and leek gratin accompanying toothsome gigot d'agneau is redolent of truffles, and must be closely guarded from jealous dining companions
But it's the solid steak frites that will keep this place in business
I went there last night with my fiance and service was prompt, friendly and curteous
But, their food is terrible
I had the duck, it was the worst thing i have ever eaten
The quality of the meat was terrible and the sauce was something that my 5 year old nephew can throw together
Stay away from this place unless you like bad food
At 10:30pm one weekday night, my boyfriend and I and one other couple were the only ones in the restaurant
We recieved amazingly friendly and prompt service
Our waiter was very helpful in offering menu suggestions and when we were curious about the music that was playing, he hurried over to the CD player and brought the CD over for us to check out

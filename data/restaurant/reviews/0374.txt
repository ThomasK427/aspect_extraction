It definitely did not live up to it
While the service and ambiance were good, the food was just OK
The calamari was not fresh at all and the desserts were just edible
The menu did not indicate that the monk fish was wrapped in bacon, something that I do not eat
The Abuzzo wine was fantastic and happens to be the cheapest on the menu
I ordered it because I had the same type about a year ago
This place was great
The ambience could not have been better
I made a reservation, just in case, and was so happy when we were seated at, what I thought to be, the best table in the house
You are not going to find your traditional spaghetti meatballs at this place
My husband had the lamb and I dined on the lobster ravioli
We ordered our wine by the glass since the cheapest bottle of wine was $60
The mussels we had for an appetizer were wonderful, as were our desserts
My fiancee took me here for V-day, and it was just lovely
The upstairs dining room was packed with people, so we sat in the lower-level dining room, and it was so quiet, dimly lit, full of glowing candles
the ambience was perfect, it got the evening off to a great start
The oyster appetizer with smoked salmon was so yummy! I had the roasted cod as my main course
Then the delicious dessert: crepes filled with whipped cream, nutella bananas! My mouth melts thinking of it now! The waiters were all very friendly, and they even gave every table a complimentary glass of champagne, a lovely way to end a most memorable meal! We will be back very soon! Thanks Trio!
This restaurant got an incredible rating, so although my boyfriend and I were disappointed the first time we visited last year, we decided to try again
During the first visit we ordered from the Restaurant Week pre-fixe menu
The bartender waiter were inattentive
Our waiter asked if we wanted parmesan cheese and then proceeded to put fresh pepper on our entrees instead
The antipasto was excellent but the entrees we ordered weren't anything spectacular
The 2nd visit was on a Monday night and it was pretty empty
We had the ravioli for an appetizer, which was excellent
so we were off to a good start
But the sea bass was extremely dry covered with bad spices
The Osso Bucco was below average and the gnocchi was pitiful
This restaurant is definitely a nice setting for a leisurely romantic dinner, but I expected much better quality for the price
I can't sing enough praise about our experience at Trio
The food was outstanding, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and the piano music was a beautiful touch
You must try the flourless chocolate torte to end your meal
to die for!! I will definitely be coming back! A special thanks to Chef James for taking such great care of us on our first visit
We recently were married in New York and held our reception at Trio
The restaurant was so warm and elegant and the food was outstanding! I've been to so many weddings where no one can remember what they ate, but all i heard at the next family event was sea bass this, gorgonzola that!   The staff was extremely easy to work with - which was especially helpful because we live on the west coast and planning across country was complicated
They also recommended a wonderful musician
I can't say enough about what a great place this is!
I went on a weekday to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday
The restaurant was not very full
They had a piano player earlier in the evening
The food was awesome
We both loved it
I would highly recommend this place to anyone celebrating a special day
The bar and ambiance was fabulous
The food, however, left something to be desired
Perhaps I was there on an off night, but I wouldn't rate this food in the 9's on Citysearch
Went with a small group on Friday for a birthday celebration
Excellent on all counts
We had some drinks at the bar first (which is very comfy) and ordered some really nice wines which were very affordable
The food was top-notch, with generous portions--we had 3 appetizers for the 7 of us it was perfect
Entrees were very good, mostly simply done not overseasoned
The service was also right on--not hovering over you, but you never were missing anything
They also bought us a birthday drink on the house which is a very nice touch, especially in NYC
Definitely recommend it
I had lunch here last week
What a nice, cozy spot! I could have stayed at the restaurant all afternoon
The Vegetable tabouli salad with shrimp was light and delicious
Along with some white wine
a perfect lunch or dinner spot! A downstairs dining area too!
I LOVE Italian food, and I can't emphasize that enough
There is nothing worse than sitting down to a good-looking meal and feeling completely let down after a few bites, but Trio does not disappoint
The grilled portobello with sweet Italian sausage is recommended, then help yourself to a slice of chocolate hazelnut pie
While they have a downstairs space for group gatherings, you'll come to find this is one of few places you want to sneak off to alone so you can just sit down and enjoy the experience of the meal
extremely romantic restraunt
had 8 o'clock reservations and were seated instantly
my girlfriend and i wanted a nice long dinner and we were not rushed
After being seated they brought the wine list first and after having brought the wine and bread they then bring your menus
the food was incredible, i recommend the filet
The only thing that was slightly odd was that we had probably 5-6 different people helping to serve us
We had a wonderful evening- excellent food, attentive yet unobtrusive service and a taste of fig infused grappa to finish off a memorable meal
I wish I could visit more often! The owners treat you like family, the bartender remembers your name, the waitstaff is incredible and last but not least every dish is delicious and memorable thanks to the very talented James Rich! I've been there for all occasions, romantic, family, friends, just the girls, etc
I haven't brought a single person here who hasn't been back at least twice! Go Enjoy!
Fantastic!!! The atmoshpere is very warm, both in the decor and the service
I have been here twice and both experiences were wonderful
It is clear that the staff at Trio have the perfect formula--excellent service, amazing and unique food, attention to detail--everything you need and want in a dining experience!! Read the other reviews--it's obvious how consistent they are
Bring your family, bring a date--you can't go wrong!
I have been here a million times and I really just love it
I love the Woody-Allen-movie aspect of the pianist playing jazz standards during dinner
I love the selection of Croatian wines and the antipastis are not to be missed
I usually get the strukli, but one day I will have the gosh to order the sausages in sauerkraut
Came for anniversary, wanted to dine here for some time
Service was very attentive, the atmosphere is just awesome, with dim lights, spacious seating, and a piano that fits in with the surroungings
The music was a very pleasant complement to dinner of oan roast chicken, frid calamari, Mediterranean antipasto, sausages w/sauerkraut and apple sauce, strudel, and grappa custard
I've been here several times since moving to the neighborhood can say it's easily one of the best places I've been to
The food is always top-notch; service is very precise without hovering; and the ambience very comforting
On each occassion (2 on business and 3 for personal), I was always treated extremely well and now almost like a regular! There's no pretension here, just great food in a nice relaxing atmosphere
This place is the best restaurant I have ever been to hands down
I planned a surprise anniversary party for my parents (with 20 guests), and reserved the private room downstairs (only $30 prix-fixe!)
The food was unbelievable, especially the calamari, sausages, and osso-buco
I must say nothing went wrong durnig the party
After the party, the hostess gave me 2 free bottles of wine for coming
Can't ask for more, perfect 10!
Can't say enough about how great this place is
Went on a friend's recommendation with a group of college friends for a reunion last week had a terrific time
The piano adds a nice touch
Try the grilled sausages--excellent
Servers made very good recommendations on wine food
Fairly priced good value even for someone on a budget like myself
Strudel grappa a nice finish to the meal
This is quite possibly one of the classiest restaurants in New York

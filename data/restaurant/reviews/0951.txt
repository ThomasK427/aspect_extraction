Not going back
I have been here twice and have had a wonderful meal both times
The wait the second time was pretty short even though it appeared to be packed
It gave me the feeling that they really had themselves together
The apps were very tasty, and prepared in a delicate way
There was actually a lot care in how most of the dishes were prepared
The service was good but their wine knowledge could have been a little more extensive
The wine list was great though and what we ordered was fairly priced for the quality
All in all, I was really happy my experiences and will be a regular at this restaurant
I had dinner here with my boyfriend on Friday night and we both loved it
We sat in the tables in front of the bar and it was a good people watching spot
I'd recommend getting scallops to start and one person should definitely get the venison
I had curry New Guinea fowl which is like cornish hen and it was pretty good but venison is better
The ambiance was great - trendy but very low key and laid back
The only thing is it can get a little loud even though there's no audible music in the background - blame it on the hard surfaces
But all in all a great experience
i loved public!! the space is beautiful and very cool without being pretentious or too trendy
my lychee mojito was the perfect summer cocktail, and i enjoyed the scallops so much i wanted a second order
the wine list has a lot of great choices from small, interesting wineries down under
don't miss this place
terrible, pushy waitresses, uninspired food(even the kangaroo), watered down drinks
we won't be going back
Truly a superb meal
I dine out for living and I don't usually give informal reviews but I had to make comment on the wow factor of this place
The scallops were divine- some of the best I have ever had
The wine list was had some of my favorites which I have not seen anywhere in New York, and when I clumsily spilled both water and wine all of the my table the waitress and manager were there in a flash jovially helping me clear up the mess
A tuly pleasant meal and experience
I have been to Public twice now and on both occassions I have been extremely dissapointed
The first time, I waited an hour for my table, without receiving any apologies
We sat so late the kitchen had closed by the time we came to dessert
Still no apology
The second time, it was no better, we had to show ourselves to our table, ask three times for our drinks
The service was not what I expect
The food is good, but with the service they offer, it does not warrant the price
I would seriously think twice before going
However, some of the staff are nice and friendly, all with the exception of the hostess girls
they have serious attitude
It seemed like all the beautiful people were eating here and so I was hesitant to take a chance on what could be a trendy joint
I was soooo happy I took a chance to experience what I can only call some of the most tasty and creative cuisine I have eaten in awhile
The food was honestly amazing all around but I have to admit, most likely not for those who aren't very sophisticated in their food tastes
For those who are well traveled and have cultivated a more sophisticated sense of cuisine I think you'll be as delighted by the experience as much as I was
I'll be bringing my clients for a tasting as soon as I am able to get another reservation
Went to Public last Saturday, couldn't get a table so the lovely host suggested that my partner and I dine at the bar
We had such a pleasurable Public experience what with between the Strawberry and Cucumber Mojito's ( bound to be this summer NY cult cocktail), the Ginger Infused White Cosmo, the Scallops, the Duck, the creme brulee and the wonderful service of the very handsome and charming bartender
We were most impressed Public is bound to be one of our regular spots
By all means check this place out - its great
That said, our brunch order took more than 30 minutes to arrive - while people around us arrived later, and there's all arrived within 5-10 minutes
The tea smoked salmon benedict was tasty, except the toast was burnt
Perhaps the burnt toast took longer to cook
Once the kitchen/services glitches are solved, this place should be great
my epicure and I went there for friday's dinner
while waiting for him, i sat at the bar and it was relaxing although the bartender girl did not know what cassava was
our waiter was courteous, at least after he found out we had more insights on wines than he did
my appe was scallops, generous amount and deliciously cooked! it might be a bit salty, but i could see they are very fresh and great quality
then for the main, my lamb was also nicely medium-rare as i requested, full of juiciness
my friend's venison was also tasty, but no impression i could recall on desserts
i guess that's a shame for the restaurants at that price level
anyhow, we may go back for bar, and grab some cassava and scallops again
Everything was wonderful
Beautiful space, excellent service, amazing food
There is a bit of a public library theme, but not gimmicky or overdone
The menu is a little wordy with lots of flavors listed, but it all works
Inventive tasty salads and outstanding entrees:Venison with fig chutney and pork chop with goat cheese polenta, and the biggest prawns I have ever seen
The desert menu is daunting as everything sounds a little bizarre but don't let that throw you
We had the arborio rice cake with caramel and coconut-lime sorbet
WOW
We were licking the plate
Dont miss this fantastic dining experience
Went Saturday night was really busy
Night went flawless from start to finish
charming hosts to very friendly bartenders and servers
Innovative cocktail list re: Coriander and Passion Fruit Margarita which much to my surprise was a tantalizing and refreshing pre-dinner cocktail
Original, creative and sometimes daring menu with many ingredients that was a pleasure to be introduced to
Loved the Scallops and the Lamp on a Goats Cheese Polenta
was to die for which melted in my mouth
total heaven
Superb wine list
love the new world wines and loved my night at Public
Thank You Public
I really like Public, have sat in the bar and in the dining room
It's always a fun atmoshere
The service in the dining room is good and I always like sitting at the bar in restaurants
Public is no exception
I thought the bartenders were really nice and actually served with a smile!!---not always easy to find in NYC
If you go, get the scallop appetizer and I also loved the spanish cheese plate
I went on a Saturday
was really crowded
You may want to get there early
Arrived at 7pm on a Sat
night w/o a reservation
Although the hostess was rather cold, our party of 2 was seated right away as most tables were vacant
Ordered a glass of wine at the bar before my friend arrived and male bartenders were (attractive and) attentive
Ordered the lamb and the fish and both were very good
Desserts need to be worked on a bit - we had the cornmeal flourless chocolate cake and were hoping it tasted better than it sounded, but alas it didn't
Waitress was very sweet and attentive and ambience was dark and candlelit, although tables are way too close together to get too romantic
I had some good food at Public
I live in the neighborhood and when my guest dropped out I decided to eat at the bar
After 5 minutes I asked the barback for some water and he said I'm just a barback 5 minutes later the bartender dropped a wine list and walked away
Then I said I'd like to eat at the bar
I ordered three apps, and he brought them all out at once

I am not a faithful gastronome (I like experimenting :) but this place has me hooked by my taste buds
I visit New York once every 2 weeks and I always dine at Mandarin Court
Its a great place to have some delicious food at really reasonable rates
Nice restaurant in Chinatown right in the middle of everything
Walking distance to little shops and I felt like I belonged there all my life
Used to be Mon Bo which was also a fave, many years ago
Live in Myrtle Beach now but every chance I get I go to Mandarin Court
Have been going there for YEARS and will not stop until they close (GASP!)
Excellent food, great atmo as far as getting the dim sum experience -- don't be picky, try everything!!!
Are you hungry for real Chinese food? Then you should definitely stop by the Mandarin Court
There's always a friendly smile, and great food in this authentic Chinese restaurant
You wont find the flashy Ruby-Foo dcor here, but you will find one of the greatest spots for Chinese food
Great stuff, but really packed
The food is really tasty and not overpriced
You'll see a few dimsum dishes here that you won't find in many of the larger dimsum restaurants
Since the place is small, the carts come around pretty frequently
But that also means the wait is long and you'll be sharing a table
If you don't mind that, give this place a shot!
This is the place for Peiking Duck
Crispy duck skin on steamed bread, followed by the duck meat with vegtables
Many of the other dishes are good, but this is the place for Peiking Duck
The Scene Set in what looks like an annexed hotel ballroom, Oriental Garden embraces the Chinatown restaurant mold
The interior seems straight out of a 1940s noir film--foggy fish tanks, a deafening din, and an alternately sweet and surly staff
Only the too-bright lighting breaks the mood
The crowd is the usual mix of Chinatown regulars and the occasional office party
The Food The stock players of Chinese cuisine dominate the menu, but order from the higher priced chef's specialty section
While some of the seafood dishes may intimidate the squeamish--the gooey inside of giant crispy fried oysters, for example--it's a good place for adventurous eaters
Jumbo shrimp get lined with tender eggplant and dunked in black bean sauce, while ultra-fresh dim sum pastry cushions bundles of fresh scallops
Don't miss the delectable barbecued eel on a stick, which puts a new spin on state-fair snack food
ive come here a bunch of times, always with a large group
this weekend was no exception there were 11 people at our table, along with one hyperactive baby
we were seated in the basement area, since the space on the main floor was full
the service there is good for chinatown, but not great for outside of chinatown the waitstaff are efficient and clear/change our plates quite often, but they are also loud brusque
similarly, prices are expensive for a chinatown restaurant, but not bad for new york city
dishes average about $15 each
we ordered soup, fresh fish, chicken, shrimp, steak, pork chops, squid, and a variety of other dishes that i dont remember
the food is good, and portions are very large
the seafood is especially fresh and tasty since they have an aquarium on the premises
the crystal shrimp served with broccoli glazed almonds are recommended the shrimp are jumbo-sized with a springy fresh texture
everything is served piping hot straight out of the kitchen
the quality and taste of the food is pretty much the best that chinatown has to offer
there are very few good chinese restaurants in the city, and ive found that his is about as close to authentic hong kong cantonese food that i can find
that said, its still a very far cry from the restaurants in hong kong (but were not there, are we?)
the total for 11 people came out to less than $300, which wasnt bad
I found this gem by following Zagat's 06 guide
It was chosen to be the top chinese restaurant in NYC
I lived in Hong Kong for 8 years and have moved back to NY for 3 years
Oriental Garden rivals Hong Kong
My search is over when I want the best chinese food in NY I go to Oriental Garden
The restaurant is a rip off
As we were having dinner there, we over heard the next table asked for fresh flounder
Since the restaurant didn't have fresh flounder, the waiter asked the manager what to do
The manager told the waiter to charge them $45/lb for the fish and told the waiter they won't be able to tell the difference since they wanted it fried
That was absolutly ridiculous!! I find the wait staff to be rude and they will take advantage of you whenever possible
If you do decide to go there, never order anything with S
P
(seasonal price) next to the price
The restaurant's decoration is very nice, clean and neat
Service is fast
The dim sum is very good and authentic, although it is more expensive than the average price in Chinatown
The seafood is good
A good choice for Chinese wedding banquet if you don't need more than 14 tables
Great Dim Sum on the weekends
Its good for large groups and you're not rushed like most establishments in Chinatown
Its clean and the service is pleasant
The dumplings are excetional
the place is small so you will always expect a line
it's pricey for chinatown, but dim sum in the afternoon is reasonably priced and it serves the most exquisite dim sum in the area
great,fresh food
extremely clean and detailed
professional staff
clean seafood tanks and presentation
yummy food!
The Scene Whirring fans and flickering candles--which also illuminate the bar's many-hued bottles of rum--contribute to the breezy atmosphere of this crisply designed spot
The Food The salads and seafood are delightfully fresh, but try a medio dia here and you'll know why this pressed sandwich of ham, pork, cheese and a pickle makes people flip
House-specialty cocktails include the caipirinha, the classic Cuban mojito--made with freshly-crushed mint leaves--and creamy batidas
Try the mangomambo--a blend of spiced rum, mango puree, vanilla vodka, milk and coconut cream that's like a dessert for grown-ups--or have an iced bustelo brioso
This spot works best for couples or small groups--it's on the narrow side
Fantastic selection of mojitos (standard or 'mojos' blended with Goya nectars)
The prices are reasonable and the staff was funny, friendly and accomodating
After an RSVP snafu my party waited a while for a table but it was well worth it
Pretty tropical decor perfect for lazy cocktail drinking, with paintings for sale by local artists on the wall
Make sure to order seconds of the freshly fried plantains and mango salsa
It's expensive for what you get but the food is good and the staff is nice
Fun for lunch on a sunny afternoon
With so many restaurants to try in the city, this one is worth repeating
The plantains are addictive, and I especially suggest the pork appetizer and mojitos
I've been there twice, and had the skirt steak and the salmon carinizado
The food was above average, it was definitely not bad, but the portions are relatively small small
(the meat portion is maybe about 8 oz's and the side 4-6 oz) The mojitos cost 55 dollars a pitcher, which came as a shock to my table after having ordered 2
That's a great markup considering that between the rum, sugar, lime juice, and mint leaves it still only costs about 3 dollars to make a pitcher
You might want to check out Monday night salsa, they have a live band
Went for brunch on Saturday and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere immensely
Tender cubes of cornbread were served in a cute bowl and made a nice snack while we waited for our food
I had the Tortilla Wrap filled with chunks of spicy chicken that came with a side of tossed greens
Not bad quite filling
but I preferred the Maduros instead
Service was prompt, attentive, and our glasses of water were always kept full!
Always a hip, fun atmosphere with good music and a crowd that's usually neither too hip nor too touristy
Go for lunch on the weekends and have the eggs Ideya - one of my favorite things in the whole city

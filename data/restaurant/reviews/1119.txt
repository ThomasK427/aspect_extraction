I got a tiny portion on pike that was missing some items mentioned on the menu for a whopping $19
After we We sent both back to be corrected, our waitress for terse and rude
We spent $122 (2 appetizers, entrees, bottle of wine and two more glasses of wine) for a truly forgettable meal
oh, and the napkins were wet
save your money
My husband and I ate here on Valentine's Day
The first course was maybe half of a sliced carrot with a tbsp of pesto sauce
I thought the waitress was kidding
I went with it, though, because I like carrots and I'm a pretty healthy eater
The next course was a salad that consisted just of greens with a very salty truffle dressing
My husband's vegetarian pasta was dry and consisted of pine nuts, wilted raddichio (sp?) and olive oil
We didn't stick around for the dessert even though it was included
We felt like we were on a Valentine's Day assembly line
It was such an unimaginative, disappointing, thoughtless four-course meal
Not worth the $55 per person in product alone--definitely won't go back because if this is what they choose to serve you on a special night, I don't want to see what you get on an ordinary one
There are a lot of restaurant in Fort Greene, but this new one is so good ! They really get it ! Unexpensive, delicious organic food in a great setting
The dining room is so cute ! The all-female staff is professional friendly
Their twist on traditionnal bistro fare really works, try the pumpkin seeds crusted monkfish or the sea scallops with fresh corn
Frank Bruni was right ! The quality of the food is just unbelievable ! They obviously use prime organic ingredients and know how to cook them
I Had breakfast there by myself last week (they have free internet connection) and loved the simple 3' egg
Went back last night with some friends in the wine business and had a blast again
My friend loved the unexpensive wine selection, the monkfish and the scallops are to die for ! I can't wait to go back but will make a reservation next time
I have a feeling it will soon be difficult to get a reservation
ici is a great addition to the neighborhood
I have yet to visit for dinner, but had a lovely brunch there recently - the french toast is to DIE for
The only slightly negative comment I have is that my husband ordered a sandwich that was very tasty but extremely small portion-wise
The service is outstanding, especially compared with other places on DeKalb Ave
I'll be back!
Went there the other day with some friends and had a great time
The food is real and good, they use mostly organic ingredients so they don't need to cover up the lack of original taste with some fancy preparation
They have a beautiful garden and very elegant interior
Service was smooth and relax
A great addition to Dekalb Avenue
And they are open for breakfast too !
Chef Gary did it again the other night
We sat at the counter watching them prepare the meals
Best seat in the house for any foodie with dreams of grandeur
For starters we had the Crab avocado salad ceviche
Crab was sublime and the ceviche was unusually prepared and unbelievably fantastic with japanese lemon guava juices plus spices
Dinner was Goat cheese crab cakes (a must have) and the duck which my friend is still talking about
The best and most interesting dish of the night was a cappuccino roast salmon fillet
A perfectly roasted piece of salmon with crispy skin drizzled with a two tone cappuccino tasting sauce
Bizarre concept
maybe, Utterly delicious and fun
YES! What will this chef think up next? Can't wait to find out
Why go to Manhattan for cutting edge and yummy when its right here in Lil' ol Astoria!
So glad to find a great brunch spot in Astoria
My girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place after an early Sunday movie, and were happy we opted to forgo the popcorn
We ordered truffled eggs with salmon and quiche Lorraine
Both were delicious, as were the Tokoyo Sunrises that came with brunch (think tequila sunrise, but with sake)
I can't wait to go back for dinner
We live in Astoria and were so excited to try this place out! The reviews were very good but we were so disappointed when we got there! Svc was horrible and the food was overpriced
Not only for what you got, but for the location and the atmosphere
DO NOT RECOMMEND
After a crazy day @ work, with no reservation, we were so lucky to score a seat at the bar on an incredibly busy evening
We had been there several times before, but never realized what a joy this experience could be
As always, the food was amazing (best in the 'hood), but we were also treated to the experience of watching Chef Gary in action
Not only did we have a top tier dining experience, but his charm wit were enamoring
Bonus- Nirvana makes a fine soundtrack for a romantic dinner for two
I have been finding more and more places to eat in Astoria, but none better than lil' Bistro 33
It's small, romantic atmosphere is fitting for its addictive food
The service was great and if you get there a little early you find yourself with few other people
been here three or so times and the food is always fantastic
really superb for the location and price
The food, service and atmosphere were very good
It is slightly expensive but for the kind of food that they serve the prices are reasonable
The place is very small but cozy so it is recommended to make reservations
The only problem was that they advertise that they serve sushi but they had run out of it
I was completely impressed with Lil' Bistro
From the attentive service to the complex flavors of each dish, I would completely recommend Lil' Bistro to anyone who loves to eat
The fuzzy tuna roll was so good, we had to order another when our entree came - we had to taste it one more time
The presentation of the food was also beautiful
The most surprising thing was the bill, We've never paid so little for food so good
They could double the price and it still would be worth every penny
Don't miss it
This was an amazing dining experience from drinks to dessert
Unique sake drinks, flavorful dishes: we had lamb and salmon from the menu and they were cooked perfectly and used innovative mix of French and Asian tastes
They make the best spicy tuna roll in the city
Please try it! And an incredible dessert concoction you need to try - the spicy chocolate and white chocolate truffles
I can't imagine anything on the menu not being amazing
We'll be back to try more
We read so many great reviews here, so we gave a try on our anniversary
The service was excellent, but food was just awful
Crews told us that they are experimenting with their menu, but we felt all dishes need more flavors
Perhaps we shouldve avoided Asian dishes? (We ordered mainly Pan-Asian dish, not Western)
There was a couple seating next to us, and they were complementing their dish (Western type), so we think thats the trick
We may try again in the future, try our the western dish, rather than Asian
For now we are disappointed
The prices are over the top for the neighborhood
These people are trying to bring SOHO to Astoria, charging more than what one would pay *in* SOHO
As a vegetarian, the two options on the menu were a cop-out (roasted vegetables or tofu steak)
I ordered the tofu steak to find two limp pieces of very soft tofu drowned in a sweet, salty sauce laden with MSG
The only sustenance on the plate were 4 mushrooms (unless you count the half of a handful of field greens, read: lettuce)
I'm not a big eater and I could have eaten 4 of this small $9 entree, if not for the disgusting sauce
Read, if you are going to try to make vegetarian food, do some research and *go* to one of the hundreds of veggie resturants in NYC
Vegetarians need to feel full, too
I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on citysearch, and was not disappointed
The small space is comfortable and cozy and the staff was very friendly
The chef even came out with a sample some new appetizers he's working on (the tuna tartare is a keeper!)
Our meal was great from start to finish

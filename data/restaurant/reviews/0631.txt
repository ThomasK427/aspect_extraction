The staff was very friendly and helpful and they have play dough and other toys to keep kids occupied
We will definitely return very soon!
You have not done karaoke until you've done it at Hope Anchor in Red Hook
The matronly drag queen who hosts is great, and everybody who comes here can actually sing (but they won't kick you out if you can't)
This place is incredible
Great vibe, great food
Getting more crowded though
hope it keep up the amazing quality and atmosphere
Thanks!
this place has the world's most divine pancakes
the decor is a lovely contrast to the grim surroundings of red hook, but pancakes and bacon make up for it all
fluffy, light dusted with confectioners sugar like some new orleans dream dont even need syrup
the soundtrack piped in over this heavenly breakfast makes every single breakfast seem like a sunday morning one
When in Red Hook, there's one place to go when you're looking for high-quality home style cooking
Hope and Anchor, an unpretentious and eminently affordable diner, has been offering up good old standards like fluffy omelets, great-tasting veggie burgers, dynamite roast chicken, and the best meat loaf and mashed potatoes for a few years now
An assortment of boutique wines and beers and inventive cocktails keep things interesting
Service is warm and efficient, and weekend nights are enhanced by the presence of the lovely Kay Sera hosting a karaoke event that is second to none (yes, Manhattanites make the trip for this one!)
Love this place
The look, feel, music, service food all roll up to a wonderful experience
Weekend mornings are a great time for a casual meal with the kids: specials are yummie
Thurs, Fri Sat nights are interesting fun karoke experiences
Favorites: Chicken Pot Pie Lamb Burger
This is hand down one of the best all-around restaurants I have been to - the price, food, and atmosphere are unbeatable
Hope it never changes
Wonderful place, good solid diner food with a twist or two
Cheerful and polite staff, clean bathrooms, good service at a good value
The karaoke night was an unforgettable experience, an absolute delight
This place is fun, friendly, and a treat to go to!
This shining star in Red Hook, serves of some of the finest diner standards -- the grilled cheese is to die for -- but with enough sophistication to keep you coming back
(You can bypass the fries for a heap of greens with a tasty vinaigrette or swap milk for soy in your latte!) The decor is crisp and unusual
Check out the hand-drawn seaman's tattoo wallpaper in the bathroom! Thursday and Friday nights, a bar crowd fills the diner
Are they there for the homemade sourmash in the bourbon sours? Or the transvestite DJ hosting Karaoke? You'll have to visit yourself, to find out
Hard to believe, but HA is delivering some of the best American food I have found anywhere in the city
Inexpensive, comfortable, pioneering, friendly
No wonder they have gotten more press than major Manhattan places
Try the grilled tuna salad - a major reinvention
Try the pork mole - dinner for two, at less than most entrees for one
Killer homemade desserts
Plus the chance to fianlly get down to Red Hook and see what the buzz is about
bless this new neighborhood fix
food is solid, sevice is friendly and finally there's good eats in the Hook! The bathroom is oh-so-naughty
The Scene This is just what midtown needed south of Grand Central: A comfortable, stylish neighborhood spot where everyone feels welcome
Branzini's airy dining room has floor-to-ceiling windows wrapping around a chaotic corner
At lunch, the tightly clustered wood tables cater to suited professionals; after work, ties loosen and a merry mood prevails
Dinner is aglow with cozy, candlelit warmth, and laid-back servers encourage lingering
The Food Chef-owner Rick Moonen's lighthearted Mediterranean menu suits the scene
Of shareable small plates, rosemary-redolent head-on grilled shrimp with prosciutto-flecked frisee delights
Beautifully charred branzino (sea bass) is tasty, and a full-flavored hanger steak arrives pre-sliced
Pastas are quite good, especially the chewy ricotta cavatelli and sweet sausage in fennel-scented cream
The food was okay, but nothing to write home about
The service was barely above that received at McDonalds
I honestly find some of the other reveiws here hard to believe
This was the biggest dissapointment
Certainly Not For Special Occasions! Bar scene was drunk office workers
loud and disruptive for those dinning
Could barely hear the others at my table
The waitress was not busy
three tables but had to be searched for each time we needed something
Pass this by!
The current rating of 8
7 is about right
The food was solid, but did not blow my socks off
Service was very prompt, but the tables were packed fairly tightly
This place is a quaint classy warm cafe, the perfect spot to meet for lunch if you want to feel like you aren't in midtown per se
I met two friends at Branzini for dinner
I got there early so I decided to have a glass of wine at the bar
They have an ample list of wines by the glass, and I enjoyed a great glass of red wine
To my surprise when the bill came, it was 1/2 price because of a happy hour special
After my friends arrived, we were seated at a table in the cozy, sofly lit restaurant
The rigatoni I had for dinner was delicious, promptly served, and reasonably priced
A great choice for an evening catching up with friends or even for a date
Plus, it's proximity to Grand Central makes it a perfect choice for commuters to enjoy a nice meal before catching a train home
Tuna tartare (appetizer) and scallop risotto (entree) were amazing
The service/waitress was ok but not very helpful or pleasant even though the place wasn't busy at all (there were only a few other customers besides us)
Not only is it overpriced but rude, rude, rude service!
The food wine selections were just right and not overdone or overwhelming
Service was a bit slow but not in a negative way, it lingers but the atmosphere and food make up for that
It fits perfectly in line with the hotel which is great!
Treat yourself to a lovely night at this charming and romantic rest
where the food and service fight for top honors
I decided to try this place for dinner last week with a couple of close friends, the place at lunch is less inviting
With all the doors open and a gracious host our experience began and never faltered
Unusual for most NYC rest
, the manager was completely welcoming, and more importantly informative as to all our options
The waitstaff was prompt and polite, and did not make us feel rushed as most places will
I HIGHLY suggest trying Branzini out, before everyone else figures out it's one of the best dining experiences in NYC
Was expecting much more
Love the concept, the location is convenient so we gave it another try
It was very disappointing again
We had two glasses of wine each, two tapas and shared a pasta for $100
The crab cake was fishy, pasta was pretty good but expensive at $16
Wines by the glass were the biggest disappointment - $13 - $14 for mediocre wine? (btw, no american wine to be found)
I was still hungry when we got home
I don't see this place lasting
I was intrigued by the NY Times review
The food was exceptional and the wine we choose was very complimentary to our dishes
Try to leave room for dessert
We decided to order an after dinner wine and the manager served us
The Chef came over during our dessert
I guess management liked us as much as we liked the restaurant

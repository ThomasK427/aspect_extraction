We went to this place and fell in love at first bite
Good wine, good appetizers! If you go try the Calamaris
They are one of a kind! Will make it a regular spot
I really like this cute little french bistro so much it's become and addiction
I eat there when ever I'm in Williamsburg - which is often
I love the Salad Nicoise it's the best around
I haven't been there for brunch yet but, I am looking forward to doing that now that the weather is getting better
The staff is nice and inviting - not overly friendly, but efficient and up to the task
been here twice for Brunch and had a good time
Most brunch items are good
I was searching for good restaurants at my boyfriend s neighbourhood, I wanted to stay in wiliamsburg area and still be romantic have good food
no rush to city! as soon as we entered, we felt like home
suprising enough we found a table right away on a saturday night, enjoyed the live jazz music
the crowd was sophisticated
I loved the onion soup, and my boyfriend was digging the lamb shank
although I m a vegeterian, I could enjoy their veggie selection for a change! this is the killing part, please please try their warm chocolate cake if you have chocolate cravings like I do
maaan, it is crazy!  I wasn't the first among my friends who tried fada, they told me to go there for brunch at their enclosed back garden, which is supposed to be very good
I will definetely go back again
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!
The ambience was nothing of the mind-blowing sort, because I didn't really get a good sense of it (usually one senses the ambience of a place, good or bad, upon walking in)
The service was abominable -- perhaps we walked in during the last hour of our overworked server's long shift, or she knew something about my date that I didn't (it was my first time there)
The food was absolutely nothing to rave about: I'm a big ratatouile fan, but what they served was hardly close to delicious
The blueberry cheesecake was commendable for effort, but again I've had plenty better
I expected a lot more for the price we ended up paying
The only plus was the outdoor seating in the small backyard, but that's always a plus anywhere you go
live jazz
gorgeous specials and diverse menu
we got there at 9pm and had no problem getting a table in a great part of the room
the waiter was attentive and exlained items we weren't familiar with suitably
our wine was kinda crap, but besides that, the room was warm and friendly
sensational steak tartar and fresh fish
I have been there three times and I have never been disappointed
The experience is just what you could expect from a friendly neighborhood bistro
It has a cute garden too
I stoped here on a Sunday in October for brunch and ordered the 'Oeufs Fada', not expecting much
I was blown away - can't recommed it too much
Dinner seems a little pricy, but the prixe fix brunch can't be beat
The food is quite good here, but the service leaves something to be desired
We went a few times last spring and one of us always ordered the salmon- delicious- but they changed the menu and nothing else was so great that we had to keep going back
I tried the steamed fish once and could barely choke it down
They try too hard with the mussels du jour- it might be better to have classic mussels in white wine/lemon/garlic sauce
I had that once after pleading with the waitress, who was so afraid to ask the chef you'd think she was asking him to sell his firstborn down the river- not a good sign
It was very good but for some reason we just don't go to this place a lot- something about it is not friendly
i'm so glad someone has finally opened a restaurant in this space and a stylish one that isn't asian! fada is a welcome addition to williamsburg - just what the hood needed
the food was great but the kitchen was sending out a faint smell of burnt oil and slowly smoking up the dining room, this can/must be fixed
also the waitstaff could be dressed up a bit, sweats and a bandanna don't cut it for a french bistro especially when you're dropping $75/for two
even jeans and a T wud be better
i would definately recommend it to anyone who lives nearby and likes french bistro's
I agree with the editorial review - when Fada first opened, it was dissapointing
The food wasnt that great and the service blew
But they really have seemed to get it together (maybe they read the review?) - the food is great and the service is much quicker and pleasant
They've also opened up the back patio - its fantastic on a warm summer night
I say give it a second chance if you are in the neighborhood
Every neighborhood needs a French Bistro, and Williamsburg finally has theirs and a great one at that
Fada is a classicly designed bistro with the prerequisite tea-stained walls, zinc bar, banquettes and rickity wooden tables
The food is equally classic and well executed not to mention reasonably priced
On a recent evening 3 of us had a very tasty Steak Frites ($15), a slightly dry buy very good Cassolette, a more modern Ahi Tuna, a side of Rattatoille, a salad, a bottle of red wine desert and coffee all for $100
Service was friendly and everything was well done
Lucky neighbors!
This cozy french bistro is just what Williamsburg needs
After only one visit to Fada, I feel as though I've been there hundreds of times
The service was very attentive and friendly without being invasive
The barstaff knowledgeable and cute to boot
The olive spread served gratis with tasty bread was a perfect teaser for a lovely meal
Best of luck in the coming years - I'll be back a lot
The Scene The long, narrow room, covered top-to-bottom with colorful wall-mounted platters and funky ceramic tabletops, feels like a casual cafe shipped straight from Italy
Friendly servers joke around, conversing couples strain over loud, bouncy pop music and the lights couldn't be brighter, but rest assured: A serious streak runs through the open kitchen
The Food The laminated menu offers it all, from fresh-squeezed juices to airy tiramisu
Start with inexpensive, sliced-to-order cured meats, milky homemade mozzarella or hand-pinched tortelli in rich chicken brodo
Don't skip salads or sandwiches: Light, lemony oil-cured tuna salad can feed a family, and warm, pressed speck-arugula panini are foot-long and fantastic
The ethereal tomato-sauced potato gnocchi will surely become a signature; other pastas, as well as savory crepes and cheesy eggplant Parmigiana, are just a notch above average, The few meat main dishes, such as heavily sauced veal marsala, are less impressive
Save room for homemade desserts instead
I have been here several times and I am never disappointed; the food quality compared to the prices is the reason for that
But sometimes on a good night the restaurant is excellent
When the staff seems to be in a groove, this place brings back memories of family get-togethers, even if you are only dining with your girlfriend
The place can be noisy and the staff seems to communicate loudly in Italian, but it only adds to the charm
The shrimp/mushroom pasta and the mussels are good
Main courses can come slow, so either order an app or have a good dining partner
My girlfriend and I had an unique experience at this place
although not recommended
First, the food was torturously salty
We're not picky diners, yet every bite of both entrees indunced face-scrunching results
Second, the service
Our waitress must have been preoccupied, since service was periodic, and inaccurate at times
She was, however, a completely fascinating character, at one point refusing to provide beers, due to her personal opinion of mixing wine with beer
She had us entertained the whole night, when she was around
It was a warm and friendly place, and I guess they deserve a chance to change our first impressions
My friend and I stumbled into Noi for a lunch
The room was stuffy and hot
When we asked to sit outside in the small outdoor alcove, the waiter said, NO
Sweating profusely, I asked another waiter, and he said yes
??? Shady waitstaff, unprofessional customer service, are just a few negatives
The waiter didn't know what was available on the menu
He didn't know what a Mesclun salad was
As for the food, it was average at best
The pastas are not homemade
My white wine sauce was actually a very oily red sauce
Biscotti was really hard and inedible
The only thing I enjoyed was the espresso and then getting on out of there
The food was tasty (lasagna-good, salad- average)

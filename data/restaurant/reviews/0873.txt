Fries tasted plasticky
Total rang up over $25 for two burgers, 2 fries, a beer and lemonade
Definitely had better burger for better value elsewhere
Probably a good deal for where it's located
This probably was one of the best burgers I've eaten
It was very flavorful and nice and juicy
The fries were excellent too and I'm not much of a fries guy
The only part of dining here that I didn't like
it should have been a bigger burger
It wasn't exactly small and I was starving, but I could have (and probably should have) eaten a second one
I can't wait to go back!
The menu is limited to burger, fries, soda and beer
Size of the burger is not very large but the meat is juicy, tasty and the fixings are just as I liked, mayo, cheese, horseradish etc
The fries are crispy but mealy at the same time, they're great
It's self-serve but that's all you really want at this place
It does get very crowded at peak hours
I went here around mid-afternoon on a Sunday and literally had to stalk people seating in order to get our own table for two
Then, the food finally came (well, it doesn't come - you have to get it) and I thought the fries were WAY better than the burger
I couldn't not believe all the hype around this super dry burger
I don't think it had a special sauce and if it did, well, clearly is was bland - the burger was bland
SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT
Nice burger with the works excellent fresh toppings, fresh tomato, fresh lettuce, powerful onion, all sliced thin, moist, not overly juicy, very flavorful, dee-lish
Fries are very much like mickee dees, they go well with the burger, pitcher of sam adams was nice to wash it down with
so, all told, 4 burgers with the works, 2 fries and a pitcher of SA came to exactly 45 bucks, i tipped a five in the jar to expedite the order, seating was very tough, a few rude dudes bumped us while we sat, however, it was worth the trip behind the brown curtain
Stare down the intimidating redcaps
Ask the snooty concirge if he has any Grey Poupon
You are in the lobby of Le Parker Meridien, a five-star hotel that we working stiffs can't even think of affording
Have faith as you intrude behind the reception desk into what looks like an unlit service hallway for employees only
Yes, Da boyg-eh joint actually is back there--a place so incongruously located that thoughts of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy might start going through your mind
It's like stepping through some sort of worm-hole into an Iowa truck stop
The burgers are among the very best in the city, and the shakes are pretty good, too
Don't bother with the fries unless you're really set on having fries, because they're greasy and mediocre
Also, come only during off hours, because the lunchtime crowding is absurd, even by New York standards
Ok, here's the charm, the menu is simple and you can't alter it, they serve on thing and serve it their way, you like it or you don't, that's the charm of the greasy spoon
The burgers are great, especially if you get it with the works
Yes, it's small and their can be a line, but that's just what this type of place is
Also, the fact that it's in the back of the Parker Meriden only adds to the charm
I think it's quite amusing that some people are actually upset because they can't change the menu and have to wait; where do you think you are?!  If you're a fan of the greasy spoon style burger, go here, if you think you're expecting something lavish because it happens to be in the Parker Meriden, don't
I waited almost an hour between the time I arrived and the time I sat down to eat
I realized that this used to be a great little hide away, but now it's packed with people, so expect lines and a long wait for a table
The food is good, but now they accept phone orders so nearby companies call in orders of 40 burgers and after waiting 20 minutes on line, your one burger will be done right after theirs! I'm going to take the high road and pay $5 more for a burger I can order and eat within an hour
The food is great! Prepare to stand in line for 20 minutes before getting your order in though
This crowded, hidden spot inside of the Le Meridian Parker hotel has delicious burgers that is reminiscent of Shake Shack down at Madison Park
The lines are long and they only take cash, so be prepared to have some
Finding a seat is very difficult as most people grab them quickly
This place is extremely hyped up but all the intangibles don't make it that appealling
The burger itself is DELISH and the complimentary fries aren't bad
The best bang for your buck is the burger + beer meal
The great thing about this place is, not everyone knows about it
It is my second favorite burger in the city (shake shack)
It is a great deal for NYC
burger/fries/soda for $9
they also have beer
The burger was great
the fries are very McDonaldesque, served in a brown bag
Remember it is behind the curtain with the neon hamburger sign
I can't believe the Burger Joint is on here
I really thought it was a secret
It's a great place to go with a few friends for some good ol' American food - burgers and fries
We had so much fun, throwing back beers and joking around
It's just a perfect place - a whole in the wall, literally and in the most pleasant way possible
Staff is delightful and it really feels like a neighborhood gem
People are so friendly, even if there is a line
And all you here is a friend telling another friend, no, wait, trust me, it's good
It's the type of place everyone needs, especially in an over catered city like NY
If you have expectations of being seated, someone serving you, and having a three course meal, this is not the place
This is the neighborhood burger joint in your home town
I don't think this place has the best burgers in NY
It might, however, be the best among similarly priced places
The burgers are very tasty, albeit small
The vanilla milkshake is very nice
The decor has a 50s burger joint feel
The service is very basic
If you are not there during the particularly busy times, you wont wait long
I think this place is certainly worth a try if you are looking for a cheap lunch in midtown
Keep in mind though that if you are hungry, one burger may not be enough
this hidden spot definitely is worth wandering around trying to find
sam adams on tap, french fries served out of a brown paper bag and a burger cooked perfectly
the milkshakes are quite good as well
It may not be the best burger in town (although it is quite good), and there is no decor, and no service to speak of; but that's not why you go to this place
It's definately a NYC 'must see'
Absolutely no frills and get there early or late if you want a seat; don't expect ANYTHING interesting - a plain hambriger or cheeseburger, with ketchup, onion, lettuce, pickle, and mustard - the words if you want it all, and the caveat under teh handwritten menu says it all if you don't see it [i
e
bacon, other kinds of cheese, ete
,] we don't have it
You can't find a better deal in NYC
I love the fries and burgers and always get a $3 beer
The autograph wall is fun to look at
The staff is great
I left my sunglasses at a booth once, called, and they found them and held them for me
I was so relieved!
I ate at this restaurant on May 21st
If that is the best burger in New York City, I will not be trying a burger anywhere else when I eat there
It was an ok burger, but I would definately not say the best! Also, when you hear that the restaurant has no atmosphere, they were not kidding
Wood paneling walls, writing on the walls, not my cup of tea!
I expected the best burger n NY
What I got was a good homestyle burger, that tastes just like what I grill up in the summertime on my outdoor grill
It was fresh, it was tasty, and it was very quick
I also like the atmosphere, very traditional for what you would expect in a burger place
My only complaint is that after a burger, fries, and a beer, I was left still hungry

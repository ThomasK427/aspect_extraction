The place is really small and quaint, so don't plan on bringing a huge crowd to this restaurant
It's more of a couple scene
At night, they light candles and set a romantic mood
Their bruschetta is different, but excellent as appetizer, and for the price, I say that it ain't too bad
This restaurant is not for those seeking a quiet, posh, romantic dinner
But if the food is the reason you're there, you could not choose a more fabulous place
This eatery reminds me of the small trettoria's located throughout the backstreets of small towns in Italy
The food is the star not the atmosphere, athough I thought Po was extremely charming and our waitress Nina was as well informed about the food and the ingredients as any I encountered
The talapia special w/ roasted red pepper vinegrette, scallions, capers and squash served over gold pototoes was busting with flavor
I thought the restaurant was very charming
I tried the tasting menu
I had the raviolli with ricotta broccoli rabe, it was very good
I also had the gnocchi with bolognese sauce, it was delicious
For the entree, I had the salmon with balsamic vinegar and it was very tastey but I was stuffed at that point
I wasn't too please with the cheese platter that came after since I don't like eating cheese
My overall dining experience at PO was great
You leave the place feeling heavy on the stomach but not heavy on the wallet
The Scene Brick and bright-orange painted walls, tall windows and ceilings lend a courtyard feel to the busy dining room
Patrons are a mix of pre-theater and local regulars whose relaxed laughter and gesturing conversations add much to the restaurant's flavor
The Food Simple works best with the pastas, as in chile-kissed spaghetti arrabbiata or linguini with clams, both cooked to a perfect firmness
But meat-filled tortellini with small dices of prosciutto, mushrooms and peas in a creamy parmesan sauce arrives gummy, and the same problem plagues the wild berry noodles in a porcini mushroom and raspberry vodka sauce
Luckily, pastry chef Mimi Stewart's desserts blow the rest of the menu away
Try the fresh ricotta cheesecake with a beautifully buttery crust and fresh raspberry topping, or the chocolate and Kahlua mousse, with a gelato-like consistency that pairs wonderfully with vanilla ice cream
There are some dishes that they pull off well (lamb shanks) -- and some that were just terrible
My dining partner's chicken was dessicated, slightly burnt, undersalted and tasteless
He ended up eating about half of my lamb
Roasted beet salad was so-so
My glass of super Tuscan was pretty good; his glass of chianti was uninteresting
Dessert did sweeten the mood: the mousse was very rich and quite good
So the verdict? Mixed
Based on the dishes I ordered, I would recommend the restaurant
Based on my partner's food, I would warn folks to stay away
It's very much your luck of the draw, it seems
Service was sweet if a little slow at times, though this not at all the staff's fault
They are spread very thin and I suspect somewhat mistreated
Seating arrangements are tight
I am amazed by the poor reviews- I find this place to be standout Italian in an area flooded with Italian- great prices, great atmosphere, good service and a wonderful wine list
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience
We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed
i can't beleive the quality of food given for such great prices
large room plus two smaller rooms to accomodate pre-theater and late night dinners
i've actually seen a few movie stars dinning at this restaurant such as christian stater
Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic
I was back-to-back with the diner at the table behind me and wait staff had to hoist trays over our heads as they squeezed past us again and again
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available
I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice
Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene
To my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six
Terrible experience
I was there on sat
for my birthday and we had an excellent time
I had the best ravioli ever
The wine the service was very good too
Moderate prices
A little noise but I think that was because of our party!
I had my reservation for my wedding rehearsal dinner for 40 people
A friend of mine had recommended this location for a private party and said the food was decent and price was competitive
When I called to confirm, they were rude and condescending - I can live with that
But the arrogant and unprofessionial manager told me I had misunderstood all conversations and that my room was booked to someone else
You can imagine the planning that goes into these types of evenings
I could understand an apology or a goof on their part - but they tried to turn it around like I had never made a reservation
The party planner (who works from his cell phone) never returns calls - and is never patient enough on the phone - just fax it is his favorite term
BE WARNED!! Rude and a bunch of amateures!
Went here on a friend's reccomendation
Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese
both very tasty
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious
We'd go back again
I've been here once a couple of years ago and decided to try it again because everywhere else was packed
The food was so so a couple of years ago and it has gotten worse! Not only was the service terrible, the food was horrible
We got baked clams for an appetizer which I don't even think had any clams in it
The meal was horrible
My ginger ale was practically all ice
People at the next table were complaining how horrible their house wine was
I would NEVER go back
Went here last night and enjoyed a wonderful dinner outside
I don't understand the other negative reviews of the service because we had amazing waiter
He described the specials in great detail and gave wine and appertizer suggestions
When I clumsely spilt my boyfriend's wine, another glass came right away on the house
The food was simple and good
I have eaten here several times now, and have regularly been impressed with the food, especially the pasta dishes
We did not have any problems with the service when we ate in, although we were there when it was not particularly busy
On weekend evenings, it is packed and I would imagine that the staff might be a little haggard
When one compares the quality of the food to some of the city's other italian restaurants, and then particularly when one factors in the very reasonable prices here, I feel that this restaurant comes out a winner
Perhaps the only negative thing that could be said is that, based on the other reviews, the service here is inconsistent
I live just around the corner from here and dine here frequently
I think this place is great! Excellent food (try the homemade pasta), friendly helpful attentive staff and reasonable prices
Highly recommend this restaurant
The food here is above average and enjoyable, but it is nothing special to travel any great distance for
If you are in the area for some reason, and want to stop at a decent Italian restaurant, give it a try
You won't regret it, but you won't be amazed and eager to return either
I suggest going somewhere else for a good meal, and there is certainly no shortage of restaurants in the area to serve as alternatives
I certainly don't regret my visit, and I did enjoy my food, but with many better competitors in Italian cuisine in New York City, I don't plan to come back
An unfriendly hostess greeted us and placed us in the main room of the restaurant where the tables were so close together that it was impossible for guests and waiter to move without bumping you
It took 2 requests to be moved by the even more unfriendly hostess

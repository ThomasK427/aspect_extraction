Skip the sandwiches and make them at home
They do sell a cookbook that includes all recipies, if you want just a sandwich I would spend the $16
00 on the book as this just about equals the cost of 2 sandwiches
Best peanut butter pie in the city and this is not easily said by me who is very picky
This is a great little stop in the village
If you're looking to try something new or just grab a snack, go here
The prices are really great too
There's not a lot of seating so be prepared to eat and run
I love this restaurant because it's relaxing, has good food, and the price is good too
It's a small place and not too crowded though
The walls have lots of fun decorations to look at
The peanut butter sandwiches are all very creatively made
I like the flutter nutter and this other one with bananas in it too
And each sandwich comes with carrots and chips
With a cup of milk, this is a perfect meal for lunch
if you love peanut butter you'll love your sandwich, but you can also buy the peanut butter in the store and make your own at home
the deserts are out of this world, my favorite it death by peanut butter
We've tried PB Co's peanut butter before, and were looking forward to the Elvis
It was a letdown - the sandwich is simply average
You can make it just as easily at home, and for quite a bit less $$
Part of the problem is that their regual pb is average - if you go, order something with one of the unsual flavors- the cinnamon raisin and dark chocolate are very tasty
Overall, though, I'd skip the restuarant and buy the pb in a store (oddly, it's more expensive if you buy it at PB Co
) and make your sandwich at home
This small restaurant focuses on a common ingredient
peanut butter
They have a few varieties including smooth, chunky, spicy, and cinnamon raisin
You can get sandwiches with toppings like the very good marshmallow fluff and nutella
But face it, your not a kid anymore, so go for the Elvis, a grilled peanut butter sandwich drizzled with honey and banana slices served with optional bacon slices
As weird as it sounds it tastes great, and was the best sandwich we tried
They also have decent shakes and peanut butter cookies that were not so hot
The place is small with only eight or so tables, and you place your order at the counter
If you come on a Saturday, plan on getting there early because the place fills up fast
You can also take home jars of the peanut butter and small vats of the fluff from the shelves in back
Lousy over-priced peanut butter and jelly sandwich
Lousy, hard as a rock home made potato chips that could slice a tomato as well as a soda can
This place is a waste of time and money
It's just a novelty store, with no happy ending
A friend told me about this place and it turns out I work near it, so I thought I'd give it a try
I love this place! The atmosphere with the tin signs was great
A white chocolate PB, orange marmalade, and slivered almond sandwich was perfect with chips, carrot sticks and a glass of milk
Very refreshing! The staff was great and even let me sample some of the other flavors before buying them! Its the perfect lunch on a hot summer day
Keep up the good work
My kids loved this place so much during our visit to New York that they kept asking to go back
We spent $50 for sandwiches and beverages for 6 people
It was money well-spent because the sandwiches were so big and filling that we had leftovers for the next day's breakfast
Being Greenwich Village, this place is use to catering to adults yet it still manages to be kid-friendly
Being asked to fork over $7 for a fancy peanut butter sandwich should be your first warning sign
Being given a rice-milk substitute shake without being told because they were out of milk should have driven us away
Watching 8 people leave the store because the staff were to lazy to go buy more milk at the store next door was a lesson in how not to run a store
No, I did not visit this store more than once, all these events occurred as I waited 40 min
for two peanut butter/banana/bacon messes
My advice: read the menu, go to the store, buy your ingredients, watch a movie, take a bath, make your sandwiches and then eat them
You will save yourself time, money and aggravation
Kind of a let down after we built up the experience so much
It was good, but the service was shabby- they messued up a sandwich and gave my vegetarian friend chicken salad instead of tuna!! But I had the pb and nutella and it was good
Would go back, but not overall impressed!!
Trying this place out was an interesting experince; Peanut butter with bacon and bannana never tasted so good
But for 7 bucks? I could fry up about 4 of those on my own
Cool place to go and get an interesting meal, which is delicious if your a PB fan, but I left a little annoyed that I dropped $25 for some peanut butter sandwiches
The dessert was really good though, and actaully very fairly priced
Perhaps this is unfair - but I don't care
Congratulations to the assissant on Sunday on ensuring that a peanut butter lover will never darken their door again (and she wasn't alone)
I won't bore you with the whole story, but 20 minutes to wait for a shake to go and not even get it then - and basically be told that we would get it when we got it - was too much NYC attitude for me
Even then it took 5 minutes to get our money back!
I was a skeptical that a sandwich with peanut butter and bacon could possibly be good
However after reading so many rave reviews about it on City Search I had to try it out
The Elvis (peanut butter, bananas, honey and bacon on grilled bread) was heavenly
I ordered a skim malted milk to accompany it and it came with carrot sticks and Cape Cod potato chips
Ive already sent the word out to my friends that this is a must visit
The tuna melt; the bologna and cheese; the peanut butter, banana, and bacon sandwich: It's all just perfect
I took a friend here for lunch and it was a lot of fun
The restaurant is small, and during the busy tourist season you do have to wait for a free table
But the atmosphere is cute and a little retro 50s, the menu is creative and cheap, and the service is friendly and patient
The sampler is terrific
You can purchase their peanut butters and other items to go
They have coloring books and distractions for kids, and for 25 cents, you can get a crazy straw (remember those?!)
We loved this place, just south of Washington Square Park, and we'll definitely be back
Peanut butter is the best, this place rocks! I loved their sandwiches
PB Co
is an awesome place if you are a peanut butter lover
Its worth the trip even if you are not
Unique choices and you can't go wrong with the Elvis
Seating can be a bit cramped though
Great place to take visiting friend
My dad took me here for my 25th birthday after he heard about it on TV
It was excellent
The peanut butter cup sandwich is the BEST! A little crowded, but its totally understandable once you start eating
In Short This little restaurant, with its nondescript decor and stocked food counter, draws a neighborhood crowd for inexpensive Italian dishes to-go
Pastas range from penne with tomato, basil and melted chunks of fresh mozzarella to seasonally stuffed ravioli; sandwiches include Prosciutto di Parma with tomato and air-cured beef on focaccia
If you plan to sit down at one of the few coveted sidewalk tables, get there early
One of the city's greatest finds is the Pepe group of restaurants peppered throughout lower Manhattan -- the to-go joint on Sullivan Street, Pepe Giallo in the West Village, and their most recent addition, Caffe Pepe Rosso, on the corner of 8th Street and Avenue C (please add a listing for the newest restaurant!)
Try the delicious sauteed calamari antipasto with pitted black olives in a light tomato sauce, the homemade gnocchi bolognese for dish that'll knock your socks off, or the spicy penne arrabiata for a simple dish with a big kick
The menu is varied, the pasta is never overcooked and the places are GREAT VALUE
Hands down, these are my favorite Italian restaurants in New York city, and I have lived here for 21 years
My friend, the Balfe, loves to order wunch here
Every time she hears the name, Pepe, Pepe, PEPE ROSSOOOOOOO she loses herself
All the cruddies, grodies and crummies in this world disappears everytime the Balfe has Pepe, Pepe, PEPE ROSSOOOOOOO
A world without Pepe, Pepe, PEPE ROSSOOOOOOO, is not a wolrd for the Balfe
The restourant itself it's a little hole with very few table
The service works on a do it yourself way

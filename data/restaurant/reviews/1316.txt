The service is superb
The girls who answer the phones are so sweet
We order at least twice a week
Delivery service takes about 15 to 20 minutes which is a shock that your food comes so quickly
Your bag is overstuffed with bread, napkins and utensils
Inside Il Sole the decor is beautiful and romantic
The designer deserves to be told how delicious the decor looks
The waitresses are at your table filling your water or oil before your last sip or dip
Highly recommend
This really is a great place -- a CitySearch match made in heavan
We got there early on a Friday night and had an intimate birthday dinner
The food was delicious (perfect skirt steak, delicious cod), and our waitress was truly happy in what she was doing
After three hours of kareoke around the corner at Second on Second (you're better off in K-town BTW), we returned for drinks
We had an AMAZING time -- Eddie the bartender treated us like royalty, and we spent a few fun minutes with one of the owners
We were too drunk to by the time we wanted to enjoy the lounges downstairs, but had a great time at the upstairs bar
By far one of the worst meals and dining experiences I have ever had in my life
Went to Ludo with a group expecting good food and service and was highly dissapointed
From the inability to carry on a conversation, vile food and bad service this is a spot that should be avoided!! This place needs a major overhaul
Stay AWAY!!!
i decided to go here on a saturday night with a girl friend and my last-minute reservation was politely accepted over the phone
i thought the dining area was small and cozy, but quite noisy (i had to shout in order to have a conversation with my friend, who was sitting right in front of me)
the waiter was very friendly and courteous, the menu was creative and reasonably-priced
the food was delicious and the ambiance of the restaurant was very nice
when the kitchen closed at 11am, the lights were dimmed and the dj in the next room started spinning music (good music!), but it was time for us to go because it was getting too loud
i will definitely go back here again to try other things on the menu and maybe stay to dance afterwards
17 of us just had dinner here the other night for my sister's birthday
We definitely picked the perfect spot b/c the food was amazing, the service was friendly and on point, the ambience was comfortable, and we all left very happy! :)  This is a great place for dates ~ it's very romantic
Also a great place to meet up with friends and just have a great night together!  I look forward to going back! :)
A big group of us dined it was STUPENDOUS! Everything from atmosphere, to decor, to staff, to food were on point!! I think we ordered eevrything on the menu there were rave reviews from everyone
For apps- you can't go wrong with any of them- Especially note the kibbeh and the fois gras- they were out of this world! For entrees- the hanger steak was to die for, the organic chicken was heavenly, I am not a fan of lamb, but was told that it was excellent as well
It's rare to go to a restaurant have every single dish be tasty, imaginitative, and have overall satisfaction- Ludo manages to do this!  It's a great group place, excellent date spot even great to entertain clients
I WILL GO BACK TIME TIME AGAIN HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS A GREAT DINING EXPERIENCE!
I ended up here around 1:30am on Sat and the upstairs was dead
Downstairs still had some people in but I figured it would be much more crowded
The bar was pretty much empty and only those there for bday parties stuck around
All brick walls and nice lighting
Your cellie won't work in the basement so tell those freaks of yours where to meet you
I want to say how great Ludo is
I went there on Saturday, April 29 with a group of friends
The manager, Mike was incredibly helpful, he explained how the place was and offered us a taste of the excellent food they serve
It was a great atmosphere and the music was good
it's going to be my new spot
I just had my boyfriend's Birthday Party here It was a huge success ! The staff was soooo friendly and couldn't have been more accomodating ! The food was excellent, everyone had a great time eating and drinking ( the pinapple basil martini was soo yummy ! ), and afterwards dancing! Everyone was raving about the beautiful space and the food! Oh it was just a perfect night thank you Ludo !!
I usually go to ludo on Saturday's with a couple of my friends and I have to say we always have fun! The dj plays hits from Madonna all the way down to 50 cent
I love the atmosphere as well because its so diverse in culture and you really don't see that often in lounges
I also love when they have the dancers in the dinner room
They hype up the crowd and makes wall flowers like me get up and dance
What happen to them though? They need to bring them back;) Overall Ludo is a pretty chill spot
Oh and the food is good too!
Fun night - I was there for a party
Checking my coat was a HUGE mistake
2 hour wait on line to find out the coat check person took off and a few girls helped themselves to everyones jackets and belongings
Fair warning- leave your coat at home
i recently brought a large group of girls for my sister's bachelorette party to ludo and we had an awesome time
the food was delicious, including the beautifully decorated cake, and we got a bottle of champagne on the house
as it got later, the ambience melted from restaurant/lounge to cool club, and we partied all night
well done ludo, thank you!
I spent one evening after work drinking Rose Petals with Felix (who invented this great refreshing drink) and Mike the manager
I found them to be funny and engaging
They showed my co-worker and me the downstairs and what a beautiful layout
I commented that there was no one there (it was Tuesday) and was told Tuesdays are usually slow and that we should come back for dinner on a Saturday
They were right! The food was AMAZING! In addition to the Rose petals, we noshed on the Mahi Mahi and Shrimp K (something) It was so good
The place really got ppping after 11 and the DJ spun a lot of fun hip hop and oldies rock later in the night
I am going BACK BACK BACK!!
At 9 pm was our reservation
We got seated 2hrs later
It took them another hr before they took our drink order
My fork had old food on it our glasses had lip stick stains on them
They had run out of filet mignon and other items on the prix fix menu, we were forced to order what ever was left
Another hour waiting for our food, we spoke to the manager, he told us he would give us a discount off our bill
We ate dinner, then the bill came, there was no discount
It was a hassle trying to get them to give us the discount that they promised
The next day Ludo left a message apologizing for any inconvenience, they asked for our address to send us a letter of apology a gift card
Its 3/27 we still have not received anything
My wife was so happy
Last monday,with 20 friends, we celebrated her 30th birthday at LUDO
The $25 three3 courses prix fix menu was way beyond our expectation
Food is refine and creative
the mixologist delivered impressives cocktails (rose petal,pinapple basil martini)
Comfortably seated in the romantic lounge covered with canddles and flowers, the staff on top of his gameoffered us champagne with dessert
I saw happiness in my wife
THANK YOU LUDO'S TEAM FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY
I was at Ludo recently for the first time with a few of my friends and we had an awesome time
We got there well before 11 and the place was already filling up
We ordered from the drink menu and had no regrets
Their blackberry was so good that we all ended up drinking them- although the sangria is killer too! I was surprised to see people eating at the bar so we checked out the menu and it was really interesting- I'm definitely heading back soon to check out the food
Everybody there was super nice and I felt like I'd been going there for years
Cool space, fun diverse crowd, great night overall
Went for a birthday
Place is beautiful, staff is friendly, oh, can't forget the beautiful dancers in the changes
I had a blast!
WE WERE 10 CELEBRATING MY WIFE BIRTHDAY LAST SATURDAY AND WHAT A PARTY
FOOD IS CREATIVE WITH A MIX OF TEXTURE I NEVER EXPERIMENTED BEFORE ( TRIO OF FOIE GRAS IS A SIN)
WE HAD FABULOUS COCKTAILS WITH ROMANTIC NAME LIKE ROSE PETAL
THE SERVICE WAS PERFECT, MY WIFE FELT LIKE A QUEEN WHEN THE MANAGER OFFERED A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE WITH THE BIRTHDAY CAKE AND THE WHOLE RESTAURANT WAS SINGING FOR HER
I KNOW THEY CHANGING THE MENU SOON
I CAN T WAIT TO GO BACK AND PROBABLY ORGANIZE A PARTY FOR MY COMPANY TO IMPRESS MY BOSS
I went to Ludo on a Monday night -- the food was really good
The service not so much
we had the whole place to ourselves because no one else was there

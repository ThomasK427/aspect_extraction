Although the service was pleasant, the food was absolutely terrible
Of the 5 people in my party only one actually managed to finish their entree
My sole came with some kind of strange barbecue sauce that was plainly not meant for human consumption
Even worse than Spice Market and 66
Yet another sham of a restaurant from Jean Georges
ambience and decoration was nice but for a check of $330 for 5 for brunch and with just average food
not worth it
food seemed like it was trying too hard with too many asian influence flavors, but not enough focus to make it worthwhile
i bet you can find many better places in the city for the price
We're big fans of Jean Georges/Nougatine, so we refused to believe the negative reviews on Citysearch and try for ourselves
I'm sorry to say they're right- although the service is outstanding and the staff very friendly and attitude-free, the food at Perry Street is average at best
The crab dumplings, which I was looking forward to, were so over peppered that the delicate flavor was completely overpowered
My arctic char entree was average at best and the desserts, to be consistent, were worth leaving as well
The tiny portions were not consistent with the *large* bill, I might add
There are too many fantastic restaurants in NYC to pay this much for mediocrity- go somewhere else
Didnt know what to expect after the last two reviews but went anyway on the first really beautiful sunday night
Went with my wife really just for the view of the river but I have to say that it was a great evening
The dining room was spacious and not overcrowded and with the sunset made for a relaxing time
Everything about the food was great
The food matched the setting
Simple but elegent
My wife really enjoyed the lobster with bearnaise and I loved the char with the maitake mushroom
Definately worth a visit
I've been here for lunch and dinner
Both were pleasant experiences
The restaurant is a bit out of the way but I love the ambience and decor
It's soothing, elegant and very comfortable
The portion size is on the small side so ordering a full 3-course meal is recommended
From what I've tried, I recommend the lettuce and poached egg for appetiser, fried chicken, beef fillet and roast salmon for entrees and the poached pear with almond cream for dessert
It's a lovely restaurant that is great for a leisurely meal with close ones
If you like tasteless, bland and seasonless food then this restaurant is for you! We ate on a Friday night - at 8:30pm the restaurant was only one third full
The tables have no presentation such as candles or flowers and the placemats are pieces of brown paper! I felt like I was eating in a diner! The food is uncreative, boring and dull and lacks any form of creativity and presentation
I had red snapper which was so rubbery it nearly bounced off my plate! The dinner roll was hard as a rock! Even the tea was weak - it arrived luke warm and lacked any form of taste
Lost my reservation, which is a shame for a restaurant of this standard
Food was just ok compared to other restaurants of the same price
Minimal space design is a bit too cold as was the service
It is chic service without the personal touch
After losing our reservations, they did apologize but did not do anything to try and keep us there
didn't even help us check our coats or even offered a decent table to make up for the mistake--we were seated by door and also watched the silly door routine of trying to keep the wind out
Service was very sparse
Just didn't feel right spending that much $ at a place that didn't really seem to appreciate your business
Unfortunately, we set the bar way too high for Perry Str
15 mins after arriving, we spoke with the hostess, who told us a table was eating dessert and would be opening up shortly
1 hour later, we were still waiting
think dessert was confused with appetizers: STRIKE ONE
Once we were finally seated, we were put in a strategically located table right next to the door
In a display of pure architectural genius, the 2 sets of doors directly open up to the west side highway
Watching the staff try to prevent the wind from affecting the ambience was both highly comical and ineffective
My wife had to wear her winter jacket while we surveyed the menus: STRIKE TWO
In line with the rest of the experience, the cuisine was subpar, as was the service: STRIKE THREE!
I like the decor despite it looking very hotel lobby / airport lounge-ish
It maintained calm and quiet while poised next to the West Side Highway
The food was good, not great
Far from great
I liked the pudding dessert even though it's been slandered here on cityearch
They kept swooping in to clear our plates before people in our party were finished with each course
Perry St is better suited for a corporate dinner than one with friends
Go to Lever House for similar level of food and amped-up corporate ambience
Don't worry about the reservation thing
Both times I've been, it's been EMPTY
Despite that, they made a walk-in couple sit in the lounge area to dine
I recently had dinner here while sitting at the bar
Service at the bar was fine, just as you would expect
I had the pepper crab dumpling appetizer and the lamb for an entree
Both dishes were excellent
The lamb was cooked perfectly and the dumplings had an amazing pepper taste
My friend had the sea bass which apparently was also excellent
The atmosphere is pretty minimal; slightly trendy feeling but not too stuffy
The decor is nice and relatively simple
They also have a lounge area to the side of the restaurant with nice sofas
What ashame the service is so lame, because the food and the ambience were lovely
We were only 2 people with a very early (5:30pm) reservation and we were completely rushed by the entire staff
We felt like they threw our appetizers at us and circled us like sharks waiting for us to finish each course so they could turn the table over
When we politely asked them to slow it down, they went too far and then we waited 45 min for our entrees
They have no idea how to pace a meal and allow for a dining experience
The worst part was when they asked us to leave the table right after we paid the check - despite other open tables! This place has quickly become too impressed with itself
I was just relieved I was with a friend and not a client
We went there on New Year's Day around 7 pm without a reservation and were able to get a table right away thanks to the very accomodating hostess
Was a bit disappointed by the sashimi (the sauce a bit greasy) and dumpling (all you taste is the pepper) appetizers but the entrees (chicken and sea bass) were really fresh and tasty
The chocolate dessert was also good (although not the best)
All in all, the service very friendly, food above average and reasonably priced and ambience romantic
And don't forget to get a cocktail!
Tried Perry St
a few weeks back and still cannot forget the wonderful experience and amazing food
My husband and I sat at the bar, and service was excellent
All of our courses were a culinary delight, each dish bursting with flavor
Don't understand the negative reviews
Definately recommend this place to anyone looking to indulge on excellent food in a beautiful atmosphere
Perry St has some of the best food in New York, presented casually in a sexy, minimalist setting in the Richard Meier towers
This is a beautiful place to take a date - go for the sunset - or to bring friends for a late-night cocktail in the lounge
The crab dumplings are filled with subtle flavor, the crusted tuna is one of the best things I've eaten all year, and the lamb entree is PERFECTLY cooked each time
Our servers were professional and friendly throughout
To top it off, the cocktails are fantastic - bet you can't drink just one vodka thyme lemonade
Perry St is sophisticated and sublime - if you're a serious foodie then check it out
It's like a baby version of Jean-Georges' 4 star restaurant - it has the food and the service, set in a tiny West Village retreat
Great service and food, but we all left hungry
Won't go back
My friend and I decided to try and get a bite to eat at Perry Street at the last minute on Friday night
Luckily, I had not read these reviews, otherwise I might have been scared off! Contrary to others experiences, I found the hostess and bartender to be very nice
We were seated fairly quickly too! The atmosphere is terrific as you are right near the Hudson river

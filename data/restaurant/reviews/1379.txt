The reservation desk, staffed with very accomodating help is adorned with a beautiful tapestry
But wait till you see downstairs
Dramatic, soaring ceilings huge chandeliers painted the same beige as the walls, a long center table surrounded by smaller tables and a second smaller room
The restrooms are also not to be missed, demarked by another gorgeous room-sized tapestry with a man and a woman
For those into mood lighting, the bathroom here doesn't get any better
You can barely see yourself in the smoked mirrors at the sinks
It's really cool
As for the food, we ordered lots of small plates, Chinese pan-Asian inspired dim sum, sates and noodles
Very well executed and quite reasonably priced
Killer cocktails threw me for a loop both taste-wise and proof-wise
Can't wait to go back!
I was really impressed by Buddakan! Althought the restaurant i huge you don't feel lost
There are many different rooms which are all tastefully decorated
Music is loungy and not too loud, service was very good, food was amazing! The portions are well sized and the dessert was big and extremely yummy! Prices are ok for what the restaurant is
Definitely worth a visit!
Walking into the main dining room, beware it'll take your breath away (not only because you need to climb down 40 or so steps, but because of its grandeur)
It is spectacular, both in terms of its details and its location (within the otherwise bland looking Chelsea Market)
The food is good
Certainly hard to find too much fault (other than the occassionally over-sauced noodles or somewhat small portions)
Service is, well, ok
staff is still working out their kinks and learning about the menu but no real complaints
Can't say enough great things about Buddakan
Service- top notch
Food- out of this world
Recommended dishes (and we tried alot!): edamame dumplings were my absolute favorite, crab dumplings with soy truffle oil, snapper entree, and tofu with cashews
Definitely take a loved one or a gaggle of friends
This place is the new it spot
The entire experience was amazing
From the moment you walk in the door you feel as if you are a guest in a close friends home
The atmosphere is very pleasing, you feel relaxed and at ease, not sleepy
The staff is extremely well trained
Whether you go there for appetizers and drinks in the front room or the full dinning experience, you will not be disappointed
This is a must go to
Buddakan New York is fabulous dining experience - great decor, with a lot of space between tables
Wonderful cocktails (try the Charm) and outstanding service
As soon as one dish is cleared away, waiters appear magically with others, timed to perfection
Do try the steamed red snapper, as well as the lamb chops
Also, great value for a restaurant of this standard
This is my new favorite spot!
The place is beautiful
Highly recommended with friends or even for clients
If you like spicy - try the soft shell crabs, they are amazing
Don't miss the tuna appetizers or the duck entree
The sausage fried rice is also a must have
The signature drinks are also worth a try if you like it sweet
If you want to make an impression - this is the place to go
I stopped in on Thursday to have a drink with a couple of girlfrieds
The place is AMAZING! The bad attitude that is so common in this neighborhood simply does not exist here
Not only is it the most beautiful restaurant I have ever seen, but everyone who worked there made us feel so welcomed, especially our bartender (Ben?)
He was so helpful and CUTE! We will definitely be back to try the food
We loved absolutely everything we ordered from the dim sum, bass roll, filet, lamb up to desserts
awesome food and two very cool places to have drinks
This restaurant is gorgeous
Desirable service; knowledgeable and very nice, but fun
Go now
had dinner here tonight and it was FANTASTIC
the decor in each room is gorgeous - perfect lighting, beautiful details, etc
service was top-notch and the food was delicious
highly recommend the tuna spring roll, the vegetable spring rolls
also the crab fried rice and the tea chicken entree
DELICIOUS!!! also great for big groups
I don't understand why a space this large (probably seats 400+) was nearly 1/3 full when I went
The food was good, not great
My group had nearly all of the appetizers, some entrees and some desserts
Appetizers were by far the best, entrees were subpar but desserts were sublime
The staff was still nervous and kept checking in every five minutes which was annoying
The space was beautiful but not as full as it should have been on opening week
I would go back in a large group for the ambience, but you can get better food elsewhere for a much better price
Just ate there and loved it
The food was amazing -- the lobster with black beans, the edamame dumplings, the potstickers -- everything was delicious
And the place is gorgeous -- different rooms with different vibes, all good
They really did an amazing job putting this place together -- cool music, dim lighting, great drinks, good service, and unbelievable food
You have to enjoy yourself at Buddakan
This spacious restaurant has an amazing dcor, subsequently the service, food, and drink were all impressive
Heat, one the signature cocktails, is terrific; a tequila based drink muddled with fresh cucumber and Cointreau (I give the bar an A+)
The Alaskan cod, and rock shrimp are also must haves
I strongly encourage trying the place for yourself
I have never experienced a more hospitable restaurant anywhere in this country
The most unpretentious, knowledgable, friendly, warm staff I have ever encountered
The food was wonderful from vegetarian dishes to noodle dishes to beef entrees
The wine list is modest and unbelievably reasonable
Buddakan will quickly become everyone's favorite place to meet, dine, and just spend time in
Don't miss NYC's next 'it' place
I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Buddakan
The specialty cocktails are delicious and there's a good selection
There is also a great selection of appetizers and dim sum
My recommendation is the rock shrimp-- a little spicy and SO tasty and tender
If you like seafood try the lobster with black beans, if you prefer to stay on the land the beef tips are delicious
The house special fried rice is a great side, and is topped with scallops
Chocolate lovers watch out-- the menu is packed with delicious chocolate desserts including manjari chocolate semifreddo which is a chocolate mousse filled with tea flavored caramel
We invited several of our friends to experience the Omakase and it was absolutely spectacular
We were served 9 very unique dishes over the course of 3 hoursthe timing in between each dish was perfect, and the artistic presentation and flavor of each was stunning! Servers were attentive and worked diligently to ensure dishes arrived exactly at the same time
A few of our friends who do not eat raw fish ordered off the menu- if youre not going to order the Omakase we highly recommend ordering the shrimp tempura and Kobe beef (wow!)
Weve had Omakase many times (in NY, Los Angeles, and SF) and highly recommend Morimoto to those who can appreciate the artistry of Japanese cooking
they have a policy of holding tables for only 15 minutes
they tell you this when you make a reservation
what they don't tell you is that everyone from your party needs to be there or else they will absolutely not seat you - this means even if 3 of the 4 people in your party are there and the last person is running 5 minutes late due to traffic yet you tell them you will order for them upon sitting down - does not matter
they also don't tell you they give your table away after exactly 15 minutes, no matter what
their front of house staff was horrible, the hostess was atrocious and downright mean
i'm a new yorker over 12 years, i live around the corner from this joke of a restaurant and i entertain huge parties of clients almost nightly

The ovaltine kulfi is divine
I expected a lot before going there with all the publicity the restaurant enjoys
The altar and narrow starecase at the center are unique
The kitchen bar section is interestingly designed
The Asian food is surprisingly good
It's one notch up to impeccable tasting
However, whatever people call the dishes Asian tapas is totally misleading as the portions while not huge are not tapas size
Overall, I would say i went with very high expectations and while the experience wasn't a wow, I came out satisfied
I don't know what the fuss is all about
The food was mediocre
You can get better food in Chinatown or any old pan asian restaurant
I eat at a lot of restaurants and I was not impressed with the creativity of the chef
I expected so much more
everything else was ok
But I don't see the point of going to a restaurant if the food is terrible
The host didn't want to seat us without a reservation, although the place was empty
The waitstaff were condescending and neglectful
Admittedly, some of the small dishes were exquisite, especially the baby corn and broccoli
But others, such as the chicken and noodles in ginger broth, were tasteless and borderline raw
They bring everything out family style in the order it's prepared; that sounds like code for our kitchen can't get it together enough to make appetizers before entrees
Entrees is a loose term: $20 should buy more than one ounce of vegetables
In fact, you'd think Spice Market could afford more china, so they wouldn't have to serve you on a filthy charger plate
And maybe then they would change plates between courses too
Finally, beware the particulate solids in the water that they pour--strangely enough, the only efficient aspect of the service
This is a breathtaking space but it's trying too hard to be a scene
A surly doorman wouldn't let a friend who came to meet our party in, saying there was no room, although the lounge was more than half empty
The food and cocktails were overpriced and underwhelming, and our waitress spent way more time fixing her bangs in the mirror than waiting on her tables
It's hard to enjoy the food when you have to beg the manager to rescue your friend from standing out in the cold
Don't go here if you're looking for a nice restaurant--it's more like a club with expensive hors d'oeuvres
The problem here isn't the food, but the service
We ordered three appeteizers - two arrived in a timely manner, while the 3rd, pork satay, still hadn't arrived 45 minutes after ordering
The waitress apologized, saying it would be complimentary
When it arrived, it was raw
Upon returning it, 6 members of the kitchen staff confirmed that yes, the customer was right
We then waited another 25 minutes, while we saw numerous satays leave the kitchen but, alas, not for our table
After complaining again, and this time getting complimentary desserts, the main courses arrived - sans the satay
I then asked to speak to the manager, who said, well, there's obviously nothing I can do that's going to satisfy you
Trust me, if you want excellent Asian food, go to an Asian restaurant
If you must frequent the overstretched Jean George empire - go to his namesake restaurant
If you're not a 'somebody', forget about getting any service whatsoever
It appears that some of the most arrogant and inept people have found jobs here masquerading as waiters, reception staff etc
DO NOT go here if you're on a date, you will be embarrasing yourself for putting up with the appalling service
Went on a Friday night only to wait over an hour to get my reserved table, no apologies given for that
Waiter was incompetent, uninterested in recommending a good wine and generally apathetic
Food was so-so, drinks are pricey and very average
Ambience is fantastic, great decor
This place depends on celebrities and staff fall over themselves to please them like they did the night I was there when a well known newscaster was there and a SNL star
Expensive, too much attitude and they are not interested in welcoming back you again
Stick to TAO
I am actually more disappointed that the NYTimes gave this restaurant 3 Stars than I am at the totally dissapointing dinner I ate there
I went there with family visiting from CA to show them the newest 3star-HOT NYC restaurant
The dining room reminded us of the Pirates of the Carribean, the waiter told us that the Duck WAS traditional crispy skin Peking style (came braised in a terracotta pot) and the basil noodle dish was so horrible- I begged them to take it away
I love JG- but 3* is a STRECH
I had dinner w/ 3 friends on a Sat night was more than surpised! I was very skeptical since this place is so trendy right now
I was expecting haughty service, major attitude, high prices, etc
I didn't think it could live up to the hype it actually exceeded expectations! Decor is phenomenal! Drinks are creative tasty! Our server was awesome - very helpful, laid back, answered all of our questions had great recommendations
For the people complaining about family style - this is an Asian restaurant! That's what they do! Portion sizes were certainly larger than tapas allowed us to try several things without feeling like we overate
Prices were reasonable given how much we ordered, but still not a place to eat every night unless you're on an expense account
Bottom line - definitely worth trying!
Spice Market is an absolutely beautiful restaurant, but there are some kinks to be worked out
I wanted to be impressed, but i just kept getting disappointed! Our waiter was part of the problem
He was not knowledgeable, inattentive, and rude at times
He brought our drinks, came back a few minutes later and said they'd be right out
He had no idea what was going on! he could not recommend a wine, and when asked to recommend an entree, had to look at the menu himself! The food was average
Pepper shrimp and drinks were great! short ribs- not very flavorful, coconut monkfish- just plain bad
The scene was sassy and cool, but i would never eat dinner here again
Drinks only and maybe an appetizer! and hopefully it was that waiter's first night, since he told us he was overwhelmed because he had 2 tables
2 tables????
Dined there last night w/ 4 friends
We were seated promptly
But service was TERRIBLE!!!- The waiter kept forgetting the order and coming back empty handed
We asked what the specials were and he replied all our dishes are special HOW CHEESY! they told us they were bringing out chips which was a bowl of Tostitos - I'm serious!! The food was decent, but just go to Indochine - its exactly the same food - but with better service
Called less than two weeks ahead of time and got a dinner reservation for two on Sunday night
Called Saturday and asked to move the time one hour forward and there was no problem
We were seated on time and had a marvelous meal
Every plate was wonderful--tuna, bass, short ribs, dessert etc
The portions seemed very appropriate--neither too big nor too small
My ginger margarita was fantastic too
Superb atmosphere, and a helpful waiter who guided us on selections
I went there for lunch recently since you cant get into dinner bc the wait is about a month
Everything was great, the food, service, ambience, and value even
The dishes were inventive and not over-priced
My fav was the spicy chicken samosa's and beef tenderloin
I would definitely go back again; maybe Ill even try for dinner, even w/ the wait
If you're a nobody, be prepared to have your table given to a somebody
We had 10p reservations on a Monday
Arriving on time, we were told our table was paying and it would be a 10 minute wait
No problem
However, 30 minutes later and after Denzel Washington arrived, our table was suddenly having dessert, another 30 minute wait
After waiting 50 minutes, the hostess, after a pathetic excuse, offered us complimentary drinks
We declined
Eventually, we were set up with appetizers
Feeling like second class citizens, forced to dine in the bar area, we ate appetizers while waiting for our table
Denzel left
We were finally seated
While the wait was inexcusable, the restaurant was polite to us and gave 4 appetizers and 3 desserts compliementary
Our eventual server was nice
It did not take long for our food, but by this time the restaurant was half empty
we had a fabulous meal at the spice market
lunch is definitely the time to go if youre going for the food

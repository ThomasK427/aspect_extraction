Our group of friends had a wonderful time at cosy and charming El Dar
The food is fresh and authentic tasting, I will never buy store bought hommus again! The service was wonderful and very attentive
We had such a good time we ended up staying at El Dar the whole evening, a place we will re-visit many times
Oh - and did I mention the bathrooms? They have to be the cleanest bathrooms in the city!
Went there with four other people some from out of town
We brought our own beer because it's BYOB
We wanted to try the hookahs and have appetizers
The waiter told us that we had to get 2 hookahs because it's one for 2 people though they burn for 3 hours! We ordered two and an appetizer
The second hookah didn't function and after waiting a while for them to fix it, we just didn't want it anymore
We were willing to exchange it for more appetizers
The owner became furious and told us that we either pay for the hookahs, the corking fee per beer bottle (which is not mentioned anywhere) or we had to leave! I've never been so embarrassed in my life
This was the absolute worst experience in a restaurant and now I understand why there was no one in that establishment when we walked in
We had a group joining for dinner a few weeks ago
We were seated immediately because no one else was there
However, as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive, we ordered a few appetizers
After a max of 15 mins waiting for friends, they told us we must leave immediately because we were not ordering entrees fast enough
They literally brought us the check and told us to get out
Keep in mind, no one else was even in the restaurant and we were asking the waitress questions about entree options
We should have known we were in trouble when they recommended nachos!
I had a great time the food is fabulous
The waitresses are great they made you feel very comfortable and accommidateling
Thr decor is absolutely beatiful
The food is made the traditional way as if you were in Morroco or Eygpt
I highly recommend el Dar restaurant to all my friends
I HAD A PARTY AT EL DAR AND EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL
Hey everybody who wrote these bad reviews, it wasn't that bad
I was twice there and one time with a party of four and we had a great time
We had the specials of the nights of which we still had a full left over dinner the next night thanks to our doggy bag
Otherwise we saw the most hilarious belly dancer - not the female ones, but the MALE one!!!!
We had fun and danced and we were in and out in 2 hours incl
3 courses
Its a new restaurant and I can see them struggling, but check out the decor: its really done with love
I had a party of 24 everything was fabulous, the food, the service the bellydancers! I met the Moroccan chef who is 61 years old the food and his cooking experience is what will bring me back to el Dar everytime
The background music and the decor is also great
Thank you el Dar
We went for dinner my husband and I and some friends, expecting to have agreat dinning experience but we were very disapointed
The waitress was also the runner and the busser! There was two waitresses for the entire place
We waited an hour and a half for our food and when we finally got it it was awful
It was an awful and stressful experience
Then we were charged 18% uncorking fee because we brought our own wine which was not stated anywhere
I have been to many good Moroccan restaurants this is absolutely not one of them
We had a party of 16 people for a birthday dinner with 8:30 reservations
Food did not come out until 11:30pm, with the explanation that ' it takes longer here because everything is fresh,' but some of the vegetables appeared to be frozen, they were so cold
The atrocious, charcoal and lighter fluid tasting entrees were brought out one by one, with a 45-minute lag between the first and last
The food was so bad 3 people who were starving didn't eat their meals
Oh, and when I tried to ask for tap water, I was rudely told that 'we don't have any
' When I called the waitress on it, she said that they simply couldn't serve tap water
I cannot imagine this place will not go out of business in the next few weeks, it was so horrible, it was almost funny
i had the worst dining experience of my life at el dar
the wait for the food was excrutiating and the staff was clueless
granted, we were a party of 16 for a birthday celebration, but i have never had such horrible service the many other times i've been in a large group
it took about an hour just to get menus, and much longer to get water
the food took two and a half hours to start coming out
and even then it came sporadically and was often terrible (awful and inedible were popular descriptors at my table)
when my food still hadn't arrived after 3 hours, i cancelled the order
el dar is a disaster, and i would have to be a sadist to ever go back there
in a neighborhood filled with good, interesting, affordable food, it's unbelievable that a place like el dar even exists
We came in, a large group with reservations
We were seated in an area shaped like a tent, with thin pillows and broken footstools serving as chairs
One waitress was assigned the entire restaurant, and the service was horrendous
Despite ordering both appetizers and main courses, no food came out for two (!) hours
When we complained -- as we did, several times -- nothing was done
When the food finally came out, we were severely disappointed: The cigars, a Moroccan dish served deep-fried and crispy, resembled burritos, were soggy, and served, to our horror, with Chinese duck sauce
The couscous was revolting, and had to be sent back to the kitchen, and the meat inedible
We left angry and hungry, and will never, ever return
One of the worst meals I have had in New York
Not only was the service awful (one waitress in the entire restaurant, plus she was also bussing the tables), the food took FOREVER and once it arrived, we were sorely disappointed
The food was, in one word, awful
Lousy service is one thing, but after waiting an hour and 45 minutes for bad food, our dining experience was ruined
There are plenty of wonderful places to eat in New York City, this is not one of them
The baby octopus entree was rubbery and flavorless, the mushroom appetizer large but plain, the pear dessert had a lot of dry cake and very little by way of pears or chocolate sauce
A fish entree was good
The bean side dish had little flavor
The service was attentive but overdone for the tiny and very ordinary setting and poor food
The little dishes added up to a big bill for a disappointing meal
JE and Carlo You guys know how to make a party! Just wanted to post my thank you to the public
You guys are great! Thank you for taking the time to exceed all my expectations

That is what impressed my firm and I so much
Thank you again Natasha  K models

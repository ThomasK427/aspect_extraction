I WOULD GO BACK ANY AGAIN FOR SURE
I've walked by eatery for years but the constant crowds have deterred me from trying it out
Finally, I gave it a shot and have been missing such a treat
The menu and service are so accomodating that even my pickiest friend was able to get what he wanted
a rareity in this town
The portions are fulfilling and priced perfectly in comparison
The dinner specials truely were special as was the accompaning wine
I feel I did however luck in to such promptness that I have to return and spend more time
I don't know how others were able to make reservations
We were told they didn't take reservations for less than parties of 6, but there'd be no trouble getting a table at for Sunday brunch
The place was a madhouse, with a line waiting for tables
However, we were seated within 15 minutes
The noise level was unbearable
We had to shout to our waitress and each other to be heard
The food was excellent
I had poached eggs on a potato-vegetable pancake with chili hollandaise, my husband, brioche french toast
Service was friendly, professional and prompt, despite the mob
Tables are small and close together, and a waitperson is frequently transporting a tray over your head
The music would have been awful (loud rock) if we could hear it
But the food
perfect
I hope we can find a quieter time to go back, but I'll never return for brunch
Recently, I made a reservation for three people for dinner
Showed up with two - the other was stuck in traffic and running twenty minutes late - and despite the fact that the restaurant was damn near empty, they wouldn't sit our incomplete party (keep in mind that incomplete meant missing ONE PERSON!)
We took our business across the street
Use some common sense when it comes to policy, Eatery! I certainly wouldn't expect you to seat, say, four of seven, but two of three when you're empty????
I have eaten at Eatery on numerous occasions and am always pleased
The staff is welcoming and the food is always good
The menu is inexpensive and offers quite alot
It's by far one of the best American restaurants in Hell's Kithchen!
I had a great dinning experience at eatery the other night and I recommend it to all
The staff was outgoing and friendly, the food and drinks were delicous and generous
I will be back
Took a couple of people for drinks and dinner
The atmosphere was trendy but casual
The staff was very friendly while professional
Food is delicious, comes out promptly, and is priced more than fairly
Eatery's a great place to have a good time with friends and enjoy great food
while the brunch was tasty the service was terrible! we waited for over 20 minutes for a menu and had to walk to the register to pay after waiting another 20 minutes after getting out bill! also, the tables were far too close together
the barely above average brunch and trendy decor was not worth it
I've eaten here 6 times now
I think I've given eatery enough chances
Two times I had ordered the special, the server explained the ingredients in the dish
Both times when the special came to me, half of the ingredients the server told me about in the dish were missing
I've ordered the special chicken salad of the day twice
Both times the chicken was cold, old and nasty
It seems to me they're using chicken that was left over from the day before
This place is always busy and I just don't know why
There are much better restaurants in Hells Kitchen
I was looking for a pre-theater meal, and even though I work in the area, didn't know Eatery
Went there based on Citysearch, and was not at all disappointed
Seated promptly, friendly, great attitude, helpful service, excellent food (the shrimp with polenta and sweet potatoes and the chicken raviole were first rate -- the spinach was pefect), generous drinks, and ran into friends
What more could you ask for?
I love this place!!! Try their mack and jack --- the best I've ever had
Also try their pasta special (always good!), and their pork chops
Great asian salad and tempura shrimp! Finish it up with the chocolate banana spring rolls
Great service, great location and good for people watching
Had lunch today at Eatery
I had the fried chicken po boy and my friend the vegetarian burger, both with a side of fries
In a nutshell, Bland! We couldnt add enough salt, ketchup or tabasco to give it any flavor
We also had the recommended E-wich for desert (brownie, ice cream, caramel choc
sauce) The brownie was dry, and the ice cream tasted like it was freezer-burnt
I would definitely pass on this one
im actually surprised to see so many 'highly recommended' reviews
i thought this place was just eh
we came in for after work dinner early in the week
the host was totally snooty and we didnt really see enough of our waiter
my mojito wasnt very good at all and i get that drink a lot
food was fine but nothing outstanding
i even felt a little rushed
it also looks like 'ikea the restaurant' - im all for minimal decor but i dont know, just looked straight out of the catalog - nothing original about it
with so many options in the area, its doubtful id return here
Awesome space and a great menu (fairly priced too!)
It's a reason for an Eastsider to head west
Don't expect anything so unusual about this place
But it's the best comfort dining around the neighborhood especially for brunch
It has a great brunch menu and prices are very reasonable
Fit for a casual, lazy weekend dining with siblings or close friends to catch-up about the latest
I've eaten there three times now and the only really great part of my experience was the drinks
Our food was less than appetizing and the service wasn't great
The bar is nice and the drinks are tasty, but that's where the yums ended
My friend had the highly recommened Asian Chicken salad, which was light on chicken and heavy on everything else
That is how I would describe the food at Eatery
Everything I've eaten there was too heavy and there always seems to be a crucial ingredient missing
I don't recommend this place if you're counting calories
It's not worth the splurge
This place is great, best spot in Hells kitchen
The crowd was great, the service was flawless
If I hadnt been on Ninth by mistake I never would have found this gem
Try the Adobe salad or the Raviolli
the asian grilled chicken salad w/the lemon ginger dressing is yums
in fact, everything on the menu looks really good- service is mediocre, the portions are pretty good and all in all it was a very good dining experience
kudos!!
I go there often for lunch with one of my friends
It's fun, it's tasty, and I'm yet to dislike something that we ordered
They're Salads are awesome as is the well-known Mac and Cheese
Don't overlook the Veggie Burger either
There are very few restaurants around that can cater to a group of people who can not decide what to eat, but eatery pulls it off! The menu touches on so many cuisines and I have never been disappointed
Everyone always talks about the cocktails; I think there wine list is reasonably priced with a good selection
On a recent visit the manager suggested that I go to there website and vote for eatery, it was my pleasure! P

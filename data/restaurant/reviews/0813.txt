Plus, the staff was so friendly that we were inclined to roll with the punches a bit more than we would have at a more upscale place
All in all, a very good evening, and a place to which we will certainly return
A must eat at restaurant, small yet cozy inexpensive yet filling
Try their wines from South Africa and their interesting appetizers
It might be awkward at first to eat without utensils, but by the time the Shiro (ground chic peas) comes out, you will not even realize
The staff are friendly and always willing to accomodate whatever your needs are
Enjoy!
This restaurant is a great addition to the surrounding area
The food is terrific and the staff is great
The restaurant is tiny but not uncomfortable
Everyone should check this place out
It's a real find!
As the Sushi and Sashimi is always fresh, very tasty and well cut, the rolls of Yuko restaurant, are of another world
I am hesitant to recommend this fantastic sushi place as our on-the-corner favorite will make its way to Sushi lovers favorite list and our 5 minute deliveries will have to take a step down
Yet these people truly deserve acknowledgement for their talent and I hope you will take pleasure in a Chef's special or Rainbow roll to entice your taste buds as you make it up York Avenue
Their decor is average but I highly recommend their sushi to any sushi lovers! I'm always satisfied with the quality of their sashimis
and they are very friendly
But I must say I order nothing on the menu at sushi EVER and they always get it right!! Inexpensive and fast service- I only eat veggie rolls but my roomates eat it all and we always love it
Awesome Dominican!! Oxtail is divine, red beans are delicious
Cuban Sandwich reminds me of Miami
Great find and cheap!!
If they have the Tomato Cheddar soup when you're there, you have to try it
It is the best soup I've had
Some sandwiches are overpriced, but it's well worth it to have a little variety from the standard deli fare
Since moving to NYC from LA, I found that most of the mexican food here tasted like it came from a chain restaurant
Also, most places are either tex-mex, or just generic
While the ambiance and the service arent all that spectacular, the food is great
Just like the food you would find in one of the hundreds of taco stands in LA
If you are looking for something fancy, don't check Neza
The food is simple, fresh, and tasty
I go for the Queso Asado or Carne Asada tacos, which are great
They have a variety of mexican sodas and beers, and if you make it there before they are all sold out, you can have a great home made tamale
They don't make guacamole at your table like the fancy mexican places here do, but if you want a taste of good california style tacos, this is it!
This restaurant very good for shows, food is really good and service is excellent
we will back thank you

Good Work
I love your food
This was my first time eating Turkish Food, and there will be more
We will keep you in mind for our next visit
Thank you so much that wonderful meal and service,  samuel and lane Cohen
It's handily located - ideal for theatre enthusiasts - but the food here leaves a great deal to be desired
I've been to Dervish twice (the second time in the hope that my previous experience was a once-off) and have both times been left cold by this dreary approximation of Turkish fare
In addition, on both occassions I left the restaurant with a very troubled digestive system, probably as a result of the dodgy looking doner kebab, which looked like something pilfered from a street vendor in Times Square
To make matters worse, the restaurant is empty, overly air conditioned and charmless with far too many shifty looking waiters hovering around
And what's the deal with the huge televisions constantly tuned to Fox News at both ends of the restaurant?!
this is the only place that I ate in the city, actually I commute th city just to eat there
Best food, elegant atmosphere, friendly service
Parking is convenient
I don't know whether it's because they know me but they all the time make discount at my check
I took all my guest there
This place has good food but the service is really bad
The manager is the biggest jerk and they will decieve customers
We ordered a 3-course special that included desert (as the waiter told us and was explicilty written on the menu, but they refused to serve us desert and said we had to pay more
In addition, they have refused to deliver at places where the claim is within their delivery range
The manager and staff are extremely rude and unfriendly
Their arrogance is not worth the food they have
i am from Boston, When we come to NYC we always go to this restaurant
Food is really good and service was excellent
Also they have discount parking cross the street $ 12, its really good deal
Managementis excellent
Keep it same
John O'neil
my favorite restaurant
They have great deal pre-fix menu $ 22
And U will have a lot of choices
Fish and All kebabs are yummyy
Its look like my mom food
You Should try
But Dont Forget Make a Reservation
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here
There are other people waiting! We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total
As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry
Our friends have not arrived yet
So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary! For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge! But, they were too big for the bun
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them
Also they were $15 each! I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll
It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!
my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy,s food is expensive but it's new york! people are rude bit again it's new york! get over it! great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
Food- there way a lot like i mean my family took pictures of it it's so huge
so yeha the price might be a little on the high side, there's a lot of food to share between 2 semi hungry people
YAY REUBENS
Very High Priced, The guys that serve in the bakery are as rude as one can get! I can't see Roxy Deli having a long life in a City that has SO many other Good Deli's
Imagine being at the worse deli in the world
located where it all started!! The bagel was actually STALE!!! A sandwhich is literally $20 and has the worst meat you've ever tasted
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food

I go to Hing Won pretty often for lunch because it is close by and the prices are right

The clientele ranged from St
John's law students to trendy New Yorkers looking for a good meal at a fair price
The drinks were amazing and the bartenders were entertaining as well
All in all, a wonderful evening was shared by all!
Good food
Reasonable prices
Prime rib of beef and most fish specials are outstanding
A place I enjoy very much!
My bf and I were there Fri night
My lasagna had just the right amount of mozzarella and meat
Salad (w/ mozzarella) had good dressing, but the cheese-ball halves needed a little more salt
The orange gelato had a mild, subtle flavor
The food is great, try the penne alla vodka
And to end the meal try some hazelnut gelato
you'll be craving it forever!
I've been here many times, and I've ordered almost every single sandwich on their menu
This deli has THE BEST sandwiches I've ever had
Definitely try their Roast Beef Delight, the Union Turnpike, and Steak Mexicana sandwiches
I've definitely stopped going to subway, blimpie, and quizno's because SK is simply THE best! They're really nice, and the sandwiches are made promptly
The prices are great too!
Went with my family over the weekend, and it was quite a experience
The restaurant has a somewhat unique decor, with portrait of the owner meditating and books about meditation
The food was great and unique, we tried the Golden Lamp which was satee' rice cover in vegetable and bake with mozzeela cheese, Thai Heaven was curry mock chicken with rice
But what we really like was the Pesto Pasto Primeria, and the Neat Meatloaf (all vege, of course)
Portion was just a bit small compare with other restaurant but the price was lower than usualy as well (7
99 - 9
99 for entree)
The only down size was they only had one waiter and once ppl start coming in, it could get difficult to get service
Great vegetarian food in a relaxed atmosphere
The menu is exclusively vegetarian, although I have gone with meat-eaters who have been pleased
I highly recommend the Thai Heaven in coconut curry
Their mock-chicken is exceptionally tasty
The staff is friendly, although sometimes slow
The decor is very blue
You'll notice it right when you walk in
However, it is very peaceful
I have always been able to find a parking spot in the neighborhood, however there is no designated lot for the restaurant
I am from out-of-town but feel comfortable in this area of Queens
I've tried MANY MANY MAAANY different chinese takeout restaurants, and this is one of THE best I've EVER had
I've ordered from here countless times, and everything that I've ordered is great!! Definitely try their boneless spareribs, chow fun, and broccoli in garlic sauce
They have fast delivery, and the people there are REALLY nice
Not to mention that it's AFFORDABLE!
this place has the awesomest falafels i've had anywhere
the sauce is nice and thick, which i like, and the balls aren't too crunchy or too soft
you should def try em out if you get a chance
the falafel balls here are great but they have alot of israeli food, try the melawah or shakshuka, or order pizza, try the white pizza
I fly 1500 miles to have thier food and pizza
All of the ingredients are fresh from the meat to the flour
And the 3 brothers are wonderful
You wouldn't be disappointed to eat here
The food is decent for the price and for the type of food you're getting
I do have to agree with the previous reviewer regarding there's not much light in the restaurant
If you want a cheap, good meal, this place is excellent for that
When you walk in, there is seating right at the door
The lighting
well
what lighting!?!?! Do the owners know that man made light bulbs
in different wattages?!?!?! It's needs more light!!  All of the food taste like coriander
The bathroom is tight and Pissy looking and smelling
When you walk in, you immediately want to walk out! The trash can is always overflowing
Wow
what a coat of white paint, air freshner and lots of bleech can do to a place! Take a hint!! Ooo yes, the choice of lighting for this room
is Yellow! The Television is great!
it keeps you from finding other things wrong with the place
Prices are great and the portions of food is great also
they just need relocate and blow up the old place
My fiance and I made 9pm reservations and were not seated until after 10pm
Why make reservations if you're not going to be seated until an hour later? The food was delicious but we were rushed through dinner because they were closing soon (since we were seated an hour later than we should have)
They served the salad and the main course together and didn't even bring the dessert menu
We were looking forward to a nice relaxing meal but by the time we were seated, we were starving and then on top of that, we were rushed
I have been going there for almost 25 years now and I feel like I have grown up there
Great food, wonderful staff and an atmosphere to die for
Great for a casual dinner or wonderful for first dates (I have had many there)
You have to have a great glass of wine followed by either a huge bowl of pasta or fish that will melt in your mouth
Dessert can not be missed either and that's coming from a daughter of a French Pastry Chef
It is Number 1 in my mind and in my heart
Enjoy and Bon Appetite
My family and I have been enjoying dinner at this place for years
It is our favorite restaurant
Great food and great service
It is VERY popular, so be sure to make reservations
If you're looking for excellent food, above-average service, and great prices, this is the place for you
The meal and whole dining experience is incredible, coupled with the charm of the old-time Italian guys playing bocci ball in the park across the street, and the Corona lemon-ice King up the block
My boyfriend and I discovered Parkside two years ago and celebrate events from graduating to my birthday (tonight)
We loving enjoying the best italian or seafood dishes one can find
Queens is definitely a place that should not be docked
Try living outside your box and take an adventure
Parkside is fancy enough to bring a date or business client but casual enough and priced right for your weekly I don't feel like cooking tonight dinner
True sibaritic experiences are not found in Manhattan but in Queens; Manhattan catters to the  American palate while this boro has real ethnic and honest places like Park Side
Although not a classic italian, I dare you to find seafood fresher, juicier and plumpier like the one that is served amongst fetuccini, inside raviolis or SIMPLY RAW LIKE THE BEST OYSTERS I EVER TRIED INCLUDING all THE PACIFIC RIM AND Half Shell oysters in KW
Tiramisu is special here
For coffee try a cafe romano in a big demitase cup, with its sugar lined rim and ask Epi to do the fireworks on it: a touch of Sambucca and the ignition of lemon peel (and human nails, sometimes)
For the best seat, ask for the Manuel Vargas table, looking at the garden where the tomatoes are harvested
This is a beautiful restaurant
I was hesitant about going because I didn't think it could be that great since it was in Queens but I was totally thrown off when I arrived
The owner is very friendly and accomodating for reservations way in advance
View all the celebrities on the walls while eating some good italian food served by professional well-dressed waiters
Reservations should be made
This place is romantic, quiet, and dimly lit- food is very good also
Parkside is situated in the small section left of Corona that keeps it's Italian roots

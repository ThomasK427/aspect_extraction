I know I will be there often
Vento has a cool space and decor
but the food was really average
tuna appetizer was delicious but the prosciotto meat plate was pathetic
the pasta was incredibly average, i think i have made better at home
the service was good
this place is also very loud
i couldn't hear the person i was with because music was blasting
this is just seemed like a big, slick downtown space
eat somewhere else and go to vento for a drink, the downstairs lounge looked cool
What can one say but it is unfortunate that such a beautiful place in such a great location could disappoint
The wait staff is kind and helpful but they still has a lot of kinks to work out in terms of timely service and attention to their starving and thirsty clients
The food is average at best and still priced a tad higher than your average pizza or pasta dish will at places I believe are even better
I felt the same about Fiamma, great location, beautiful place but the food misses again
In Short A few plants and quiet rice paper paintings under inverted sconces add warmth to a cool decor dominated by stark white walls, jet black furniture and a wall-sized projection of an analog clock
Where Thai Sky gets its sensory color is from a menu on which over half the entrees are marked with a chili pepper
From house specials like salmon with chu chee curry to vegetarian dishes like basil noodles, hot dominates
Just had a great lunch here - ordered the basil tofu lunch with the friend tofu that had a delicious sweet sauce with crushed peanuts
I was looking to have all of the hype fufilled and found exactly what I Expected
The basil stir fry was delicious and very filling, with the service sparse and a bit off putting
We didn't see the solitary waitress after seating ourself for over 10 minutes
the food was pretty hot but not fresh from the kitchen
All these complaints and you still love it? yep
it was delicious and 6 dollars!!!
I like Thai Sky, and the lady who runs it is very sweet
Quick note: they do take credit cards now
The food is spicy like it should be not swimming in oil like it is at song down the street
Not a destination spot as far as ambience goes, but if you're in the neighborhood and want a good, quiet meal it's worth a trip
My girlfriend and I are Thai aficionados and are constantly in search of delicious thai food at reasonable prices
Gently put, Thai Sky aint it
Although the service was good and the presentation was appetizing, the food itself was drastically subpar
Evidenced by the overused chili pepper heat, no doubt intended to drown out the confused medley of rank cuisine they provide
Odd, traditional and clashing decor will only detract from your experience if the square box layout or perma-draft through the pane glass door doesn't get you first
Go to Pat Pong in the East Village, Mango Thai on 7th Avenue Brooklyn or Lemongrass in the West Village for affordable thai food done right - anywhere but Thai Sky! And for God sakes lower this rating

7?, give us a break
Whenever I go to Thai Sky, I get the curry puffs
They're just yummy
Also, love the stuffed chicken wings
For a main course I get the creamy and lightly spicey shrimp and scallops in red curry sauce
The red snapper with a sweet and tangy mango salad topping is out of this world
The staff is always freindly and helpful whenever I've been there
My friends and I go to Thai Sky for their tasty food
We especially like their curry puffs, among the best, and stuffed chicken wings
This is a place that isn't afraid of using spice
For the main course try the shrimp and scallops in a rich, creamy, and not too spicy red curry sauce
Another favorite is the whole crispy red snapper topped with a delicious mango salad
The staff are very friendly, helpful and attentive
My husband and I have been going to Thai Sky since they opened and have always been impressed
What they lack in decor they make up in wonderful, spicy, authentic Thai dishes
We are always promptly seated and the service is among the best we have expereinced--always friendly
I highly reccommend the Yellow Curry with Chicken or the Koi Soy Gai which is often on the specials menu
For an appetizer you can not go wrong with the curry puffs or the stuffed chicken wings
We have eaten both in the restaurant and ordered take-out with no problem at all, so I am surprised to see any negative remarks
As a regular customer, I have never been disappointed
Great good and a great price
I attempted to order from their lunch menu at 3:30PM when I was told that I should call earlier in the future
When I explained that I had been working hard all day and lost track of time, the woman taking my order responded by telling me that she had been working hard all day and wanted to make a profit
She went on to say that she barely made a profit from $6 (the cost of the lunch menu)
With that obnoxious remark, I will not be ordering from their lunch menu or any other menu of theirs ever again
Especially since the food is average at best (below average for Thai)
We gave this place 3 tries for delivery and they failed
The only acceptable dish we tried was the vegetable dumplings, everything else was either too greasy, too bland or carelessly prepared
The Tom Yum is very cloudy and is full of huge chunks of food service onions and green peppers, nothing like the the delicately spicy concoction it should be
All fried apps were dripping with oil
The pad thai had absolutely no flavor and the shrimp seemed like it was frozen and defrosted several times
With so many decent Thai spots nearby, this place is just not worth it
Added to the usually delightful waitstaff, is the quality of the food
I usually am never disapointed when I order from Thai Sky
The project clock is a cute feature at this cozy little neighborhood Thai restaurant
Great Thai for takeout, and good to eat in as well
Probably the best thai value in Park Slope
Not great for eating in, but still a nice exprience
The food at Sal Anthony's is wonderful
Anything we order is incredible
The owner/chef takes real pride in his food and his clients
Right now the restaurant is small but he is expanding
If you live in the area please go and experience great cuisine
My simple delivery order took over double the promised time, the simple, Margarita pizza arrived COLD, without a trace of any fresh basil, and really greasy
The accompanying now soggy salad arrived with the normal dressing smeared all over instead of the substitution the order-taker had said was possible
I waited 65 minutes for the worst delivery I have had in my year in Hoboken
I regret having provided my address at the end of the order taking transaction when the order taker failed to inquire my apt number or confirm the address
A total waste of $
The dining room is loud and uninviting, the food is pricey for what it is, and the service and presentation is poor
The menu is limited
Cesar salad with pathetic chicken slices served on a plastic diner plate that slid all over the table, unfriendly cashiers
I ordered a salad with apples and was told--after paying and when my order was up--that they were out of apples
Certainly not worth the trek over to the water front
although ambiance was nice
the service was lacking and we sat there forever before a waiter finally came to us
the presentation was good but the food wasnt worth the price given
the yellow tartar we ordered was too salty and the rock shrimp tempura tasted like candy gone wrong
its too bad the food wasnt as good as the looks
I have been to this little place about 20 or 30 times
The food is really outstanding and the service is really friendly
The BBQ was rated best in the state by the Star Ledger
Try anything! It's all good
new year eve, i take dinner with my best friends
thats my first time come to this restaurant
this restaurant so romantis they have big screen tv so we can watch food channel, travelling n sport channel

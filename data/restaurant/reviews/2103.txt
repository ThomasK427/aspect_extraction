We had enough
Go there only if you are willing to accept rude and snob service
We'll never go back again
My friend and I picked this place based on pure location - we had no idea what an amazing place it would turn out to be!!! The dcor gives you the sensation of being in someones house for dinner, the food was incredible, and their staff was beyond upbeat and friendly
We asked a gentleman (turned out to be one of the owners) a question about the wine and he was so incredibly helpful and friendly
He not only made a few suggestions about wine but told us about some of the entertainment they have downstairs after 8:30! On the way out my friend and I made a reservation for our dinner club in February so we can share this gem with our friends!
I like the relaxed feeling of this place
I went to one of the reading series
It was lovely and I was given a free glass of wine with my cover charge
A free drink in NYC, it's about time
When I was waiting for the series, they gave me chips and salsa, almost insisting I eat something
LOL
Just precious
Cornelia Street Cafe is always pleasant
The brunch is delicious and a great value
It's right around the corner from my apartment and always my first choice to take visitors and friends alike
Great relaxing outdoor seating in the summer and cute interior for a casual dinner
The warm goat cheese salad would be worth crossing the Atlantic for! I stopped by after a long day of shopping and sat outside with my dog
They brought her water and could not have been nicer
It is the perfect little neighborhood bistro and I will be coming back even though I don't live in the neighborhood and will have to take a cab
I am anxious to try brunch!
Cornelia's was cozy and inviting, and the service was great
Cute place for a small group or a quiet date
The salmon is cooked to perfection and the chilean wine is great
A sure bet every time
Simple place, simple choices
If you're hungry, get the Prix fix--the chicken is incredible, and filling
Great wine list, good deserts--the brownie with carmel-espresso sauce is amazing
But seriously, its a great date place
(sit by the fireplace or the windows
)When you want a nice meal that won't break you for the rest of your evening, at a cozy little place thats not about 'the scene' go to Cornelia
You won't regret it
Good food cozy setting- unless you are near the door- then you will freeze and no one cares (rememebr to ask to be sat in one of the back rooms when making reservations in the winter)
Very attentive service and a fun wine list that will appeal to all tastes and budgets
Have been itching to try this place for awhile, and finally got there on a rainy night
Good service, food well executed but not terribly earth shattering
and while not extensive, enough choices on menu for all types
We probably should have stuck w/the prix fixe -- at 19
97 a fabulous deal, but instead went w/a la carte, which wasn't bad, though portions on smallish side
but adequate when you added the salads and dessert we split as well
Definitely romantic in the rain, but avoid sitting near large groups, or groups w/lots of noisy kids/adults if you can
:)
A great place for a dinner with a friend or a date
Get a table by the windows in the summer - feels like you're eating on the sidewalk without having everyone be on top of you
The menu is a bit small, but the choices are all strong
The spinach salad and the mussels are both good choices
The service is leisurely without being bad and the waiters are very friendly
The wine specials can't be beat - interesting bottles with lite prices
Definitely stop by!
Cornelia Street Cafe offers a nice dining experience
The menu offers few ordering options but the quality is good
Strongly recommend the Thai seafood soup with tomato/basil salad
Went there last thursday to hear my friend Jason Shain play
Nice little set up down stairs for a small crowd
The place makes you feel like you are amongst friends
Jason Shain Rocks!
The Scene Given a quick makeover, this Carmine Street outpost of the popular Yama chain could easily pass for a trattoria, as fireplaces and exposed brick walls lend the space a rustic country-home vibe
Night after night, the restaurant is packed, and young couples on dates crowd the front two rooms, the tiny sushi bar and the umbrella-covered deck out back
The Food Tasty appetizers like crackling fried soft-shell crabs with a sweet ponzu sauce, wasabi-flavored steamed pork dumplings, and Japanese eggplant with miso paste make a good segue into fresh-tasting sushi entrees like the sushi deluxe, which represents one of the better values anywhere
Yama's portions tend toward the gargantuan--the massive wooden boats and platters of sushi that serve groups seem sized to feed twice as many people as they claim to satisfy
But be wary of Yama at peak hours, as the wait for food can get lengthy
Great fresh sushi that's moderately priced
You'll leave satisfied, I love to take my friends here and the ones that have gone have really liked the place and the food
Although the title of my review tells you how I feel about the path of this restaurant, I have dined here many times before and have enjoyed all of my meals
However, the service has been going downhill recently
We had a very rude hostess last week
Go for the food and just that
My fiancee and I went last night and left stuffed! The sushi rolls were huge, with lots of fish in each, but some of them fell apart when picked up
NOT a problem! The food is still there! The Eel was fantastic, the spicy tuna rolls were great
and the large hot sake is enough for two, easily
We were seated immediately at 8:00pm on a Friday night, after making a same-day reservation
Just recently moved to the West Coast, I've been trying desperately to find ANY sushi restaurant that even comes close to Yama on Carmine in NYC!! The fish is impeccable, the service unforgettable and the prices are so reasonable
I can't wait to come back to visit - just to hit my favorite sushi joint! The Crispy Shrimpy is by far my favorite (no one can do it right out here in Cali) - followed by any selection of sashimi! Outstanding and a truly missed aspect of New York for me!!
For someone with a large appetite who loves sushi, this place is a dream come true
And the fish is pretty much top notch
No grade B fish here
Reasonably priced for what you get
Yama serves some of the freshest sushi around
However, another important factor in any assesment of sushi is the meat cut
This is where Yama faulters
The fish/rice combination is best suited for bite sized morsels, not monster sized peices and enough rice to warrant the use of knife, fork and spoon
Oversized sushi atop too much rice has one usual result: a messy plate of raw fish and rice
In that case, why not just order sashimi?  I praise Yama for its freshness and its aesthetic, at least in terms of appearance, but appearance isn't eveything and I criticise Yama for it's bigger is better gimick
Nothing fancy, but the sushi was all fresh and extremely good
Highly recommended!
I don't understand the negative reviews
I think this place is great
Sure, the pieces are huge, but they are very fresh and of good quality
The rolls are amazing! Definitely try it!
Ok i do see many negative reviews, but my experiance here was a good one
sure the sushi is cut big but it was very fresh and juicy to me
The rolls are stuffed with a lot of fish which I think is a good thing, better then stuffed with a lot of rice and a thread of fish right? the handrolls are huge and worth every penny
Go, try this place out, just don't order too much like I did! Remember the cut BIG pieces! enjoy!
Don't be fooled by the oversized pieces of fish
The quality is above average, but not top notch
the sushi here was so big it could have been served with a pitchfork, there was no sense of delicacy or finese
The only thing that seems to make this popular is the size of sushi-but I find that to be one of the reasons to stay away
There's too much rice for the fish
I guess to cut cost?!?!? I'd rather pay more and eat quality
Yama will be voted best sushi in 2003, and every year following so long as the restaurant continues to place large, fresh, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of fish on balls of rice

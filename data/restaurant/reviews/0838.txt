Unfortunately, the organic fries were soggy and the veggie slaw lacked flavor
The place in general is small but was kept clean
The tables and chairs were continuously kept clean by the wait staff
The place can be packed with takeout customers standing around the small dining area waiting for their orders
Another thing is that the music is way too loud, making conversation a challenge
When the place got packed with customers, they turned off the music
Maybe, the counter staff themselves could hardly hear their customers orders?
I'd tried this place a couple of years ago and was underwhelmed
I just tried it again and came away feeling the same
I really wanted to like a place I could get a healthy burger, but:  * the service was sloppy (I didn't get my drink, and when I checked on it I discovered the guy had put me down for the wrong drink);  * the food (in this case a hot dog with fries) was so-so; and  * the mango-orange smoothie was nothing special
I don't mind paying a premium for healthy food, but it has to be *yummy* healthy food
In terms of the facility -- the AC was on way too high, and there were a couple of tables that needed wiping, and there were enough staff and little enough business at the time that somebody could have wiped them
When I first walked past this shop I thought it was a cellphone store
The bright orange and clean looking decor attracted me
Upon examination of the menu I was curious to taste these healthy burgers/fries
I tried the chicken burger and added marsala mushrooms
IT was simply DELICIOUS! ! The bun,freshvegetables,chicken,mushrooms
combination was WONDERFUL
The fries were so-so
healthy tasting but kinda soggy
5 stars for the burger though!
Better Burger is my favorite eatery for a guilt-free burger experience
My favorites are the chicken burger with marsala mushrooms, baked fries (they are amazing)and the caramel espresso smoothie
I like knowing that the meat is organic and/or naturally raised
It is the only place where I let my daughter eat a burger
Knowing that the food is both better for you and tastes good too, makes better burger a must eat here now place!
For those of us who have just got to have their burger but can't stand all the oil and grease
Well does Better Burger have a place for you
While the burgers here dont carry the same taste as regular fried ones, they have a zingy kick to them that'll still fill you up without leaving that nasty grease-high normal fast food leaves you with
If nothing else the premium location on the corner of 19th and 8th is a great place to just kick the afternoon people watching the denizens of Chelsea
The best fast food you could ask for! This place is amazing from the soy burger to the ostrich, they seem to get everything right
And, I can't believe they're not real--the french fries that is!!! Better Burger is the best burger!
Everything's better here, not just the burgers
I've had the time of my life trying their different burgers with all the various fixin's
I can't wait to go again and again!
If you have a hankering for a burger, but want to bypass the grease, head over to better burger! My favorite is the chicken burger marsala and I love fries, but usually try to avoid them (because of the fat), but here I eat them without feeling guilty
The smoothies are great too, i am partial to the caramel espresso for a jolt of caffeine to perk my up in the afternoon
Finally! You can enjoy a great burger and crunchy fries without clogging your arteries
The air-baked Better fries are sooooo light and tasty esp with all the delicious sauces
I took my friends for a Thursday night pigout and we left feeling fulfilled without the grease and calories weighing us down! The answer to our prayers, Better Burger keeps picky New Yorkers healthy and happy
I am a sushi lover and so it my boyfriend (he lived in Tokyo for a while)
I have to say, that my little take out place around the corner has one of the best fresh sushi in NY
One night my boyfriend and I actually went there and talked to the owner
He told us that they receive their sushi from a special importer in NJ
Don't get me wrong
It is nothing for a romantic dinner
But if you want to get one of the freshest fish to a reasonable price in town, I totally can recommend this place
The Uni (sea urchin) is delicious
The Kai Kai Specialty that I ordered (Shrimp Penang Curry) was shockingly spicy, such that I couldn't taste anything
But the bigger problem was that there was hardly anything to taste - 3 shrimps does not an entree make
this is one of the worst places to eat
veggie burger w/fries - 10
50
buffalo wings - is basically fried chicken
cappacino was horrible, isn't even real cappacino
too overpriced, food was terrible
not worth it at all
This place is quite expensive
Only authentic sushi is served, so no spicy tuna, no crunchy rolls etc
The service is incredibly polite and attentive
I only saw Japanese clientele
All the spots were reserved on Saturday night meaning no walk ins allowed
The fish was incredibly fresh, tried snapper sashimi which was quite nice
Its worth coming here for the sushi, I didn't particularly care for the hot dishes-many other do that better
Overall Excellent
I would sum up this restaurant as having excellent quality of food, enormous a-la-carte sushi selection for serious sushi lovers
Once again, no art sushi here
Food can be enjoyed in a very private setting, with the front window screened off inside a very clean interior
Portions are a bit small so you tend to get overwhelmed at the check out counter when you've realized that you ordered a bit too much
I am Japanese from Tokyo
I tried so many sushi/ Japanese restaurants in NY
I would say this is the best sushi restaurant!! I feel that I am in Tokyo when I eat there
Great fish and simple plates
This is not like any other American style roll sushi restaurants, this is a place where real Japanese people go and trust
Been a regular for several months now
In the tradition of Sushi Say and other No frills sushi bars, excellent high level quality of fish prepared by a skilled sushi chef
Perfectly sliced fish bring out the best of traditional sushi
If you need exotic rolls and other creations to satisfy your tongue, go elsewhere to other great sushi places like Sushi of Gari
However, if you want a no frills traditional sushi place that specializes in serving up high quality fish, come inside
Also try the course meal if you want more than just sushi
Very tasty dishes all around with a nice collection of affordable sake
The wait staff is very courteous
Just try not to ask for their cold sake hot or for a spicy tuna roll and you will be fine
If you love Sushi Yasuda or Jewel Bako, you'll love this place
If you're a california roller or like to supersize it at Yama, don't bother
For me, this, along w/ SY and JB, is the best sushi in NY
This is the worst place I've ever eaten
Service is sooooo slow, cooks and cashier are abrupt and disinterested and waiters are non-existent
Steaks are in pre-packaged vacuum sealed plastic, they are tough and taste like
NOTHING
Mashed potatoes are from the box (just add water), and sloppy salad
SIMPLY AWFUL!!
Eating here was a surprisingly pleasant experience
Waiters are so attentive, without being irritating
I was surprised by just how good the food was here! The sushi rolls were wonderful and the Fire Wok was truly amazing
Highly recommended
The place is very relaxed, quiet, romantic w/ high ceilings and views of the harbour
Food has always been consistent and good
Not an inexpensive place but you get your money's worth
The Scene  Calling Park Slope's cutest hole-in-the-wall a restaurant would be a stretch, considering that most walk-in closets have more room

I haven't been to River Cafe in many years
I booked it for an anniversary dinner, which turned out to be a stormy night, but the experience at River Cafe was still as special as I remember it
I had one complaint about the service, because it took a very long time before anyone asked us about drinks or brought a menu, but from there on, it was superb
All of the dishes we ordered were much better than I was expecting after hearing the kitchen had declined in recent years
The very best part, though, was that I booked through OpenTable and mentioned it was for a anniversary
Without another word when we arrived, they added a chocolate decoration saying Happy Anniversary to our desserts
Nice touch! Will definitely return for special occasions
The most romantic restaurant that ever was and will be, if you can go around the Christmas Holiday
It is absolutely spectacular with impecable service
Men must wear a coat
A very classy place
My boyfriend and I were looking for ea special treat in a new place and since Brooklyn has become very trendy I heard of the River Cafe as being the best brunch and city view one could get
The food was exquisite!! So was the service, very attentive and polite
The scene is very family oriented; the place sits large groups, mainly WASPI
We had a fantastic brunch over bellines and kissing in our little red booth
Highly recommended for a special brunch with a special someone, be prepared with lots of cash though!
The River Cafe made me feel as if we were in an old English fairy tale garden under the shadow of the majestic Brooklyn Bridge
Lights twinkled welcomingly from the trees surrounding the front door
Ive never seen downtown Manhattan so breathtakingly stunning
For appetizers, I ordered Stuffed Shrimp, while my fianc ordered Rabbit and Ravioli
Both were delectable
For our main course, we had the sirloin, cooked to perfection
It was topped with pan roasted new onions and it lent the meat a great flavor
It was also served with the best Mushroom Marrow Tortellini
For dessert I had Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge
It was presented beautifully with a replica of the Brooklyn Bridge
My fianc ordered Coffee Caramel Parfait for his dessert, also very good
Finally, the service was just right
I felt well pampered
It was without a doubt the perfect place to celebrate our engagement
I just didn't understand the negative reviews
I thought the service was wonderful- they made us feel like royalty
They may have been slow on initiating service, but I believe that was simply so you would not feel rushed; people take their time here
All we had to do was let our waiter know we were ready, and it was done
The staff is incredibly polite, the view- spectacular
The food- succulent
Do try the vegetarian gnocchi
The River Cafe is my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, quite possibly my favorite overall!
I was planning a surprised birthday dinning for my wife
After I already made a reservation at the restaurant, I found the last 2 bad reviews
They made me feel so nervous
Thanks God! I didnt believe those reviews
The restaurant was classy, cozy and very romantic
The view is perfect
We were well treated from the valet parking guy to the bus boys
The food is excellent
Their wine was great selected
My wife loved it even she doesnt really drink
We had a wonderful time
All I can say is the best restaurant ever
Dont be misguided by other people
You should check it out by yourself like we did
Don't eat here
The food was average and the service was horrible
After being ignored by our waiter we complained to the manager who assured us everything would improve
It didn't
Our service remained subpar and we weren't compensated at all
Any good restaurant will do something (free desert/easy reservation) to make up for poor service
When I called back to speak to another manager I was given the impression that they didn't really care that I wan't happy
The sign of a good restaurant is how they handle a complaint and whether they show customers they appreciate their business
Since they don't appreciate my business, I'll spend my money elsewhere
And tell everyone I know to do the same
If you want the exact same view, walk along the Brooklyn Heights promenade
Then go to Gramercy Tavern or Nobu for a truly outstanding restaurant
Because this isn't one
I took a group of 6 business associates for dinner, and the service was very bad (I guess since they were adding the tip to the bill themselves -- no opportunity to punish for bad service, except here)
Very inattentive dinner took 4 hours
Somehow the $78/person price fix got up to over $110/person with no one drinking alcohol
Nice flowers view
Food good but not spectacular
I'm a big Brooklyn booster, and really wanted to like this place, but I was disappointed
Service is great! Food is great! View is great! Price is reasonable too! Two people with a 1/2 bottle wine, dessert tea and 20% tip comes up to $216 but it is worth every single dime
Highly recommended
Forget about going to restaurants like Butter and getting yourself bullied by the waiters
I came here in March 2004 with my fiancee for lunch
We had a 12 noon sitting as we couldnt book for 2 oclock
Strangely we were the only people dining though! The food was the best I have ever tasted
I had the foie gras followed by the duck which was cooked to perfection
My fiancee had scallops then fillet mignon and was just as impressed
The service was unobtrusive despite us being the only diners
We missed out on the view because of cloud but it was snowing in a romantic location so cant complain really
We'll be coming back for our honeymoon!
This restaurant fulfilled my expectations regarding the famed view, service and overall quality of the experience
It was booked for dinner on Sat 5/21, so we did lunch, which was probably just as well because we enjoyed the daytime view and took the Water Taxi back to Manhattan
Staff were courteous but non overly invasive and extremely kind
My date did not drink and we didn't get any sour looks when I turned down the wine list
The courses were nicely prepared and pleasant
The fish was great and the desserts really topped it off
I had a very memorable time and would definitely recommend this place for that special occasion!
I have only been to the River Cafe once but I am planning to go back already
I went for the Sunday brunch and it was amazing
Everything from the little tastes prepared by the kitchen to the main course to dessert was outstanding and the beauty of the restaurant makes it that much nicer
Soothing piano playing with the beautiful view and great food provides for a very memorable occasion
Sure this doesn't come cheap but we are not talking about a grand slam breakfast at Denny's here
my boyfriend made a reservation there for Valentine's Day
very romantic ambience
best view you can ever imagine
great sevice
friendly staff
we had valantine's day special 5 course dinner

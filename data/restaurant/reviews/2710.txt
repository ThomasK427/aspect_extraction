At it's best, it's amazing; you just have to know what to order
Best choices: pepperoni, olives, sundried tomatoes
Worst: mushrooms (too soggy)
Stick with the drier toppings and you can't go wrong!
In my humble opinion this is great pizza, and worth the trip to Brooklyn
Great sauce and the perfect crust
Take a stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge when you are done, since you will eat more then you should
The pizza here is totally overrated
Sure its in a cool location, but its not worth the price you pay
The sauce is unremarkable in every way, and no amount of toppings is going to make it better
It will just make you pizza more of a disappointment when you get the check
I've had MUCH better at random divey places throughout the city
But it couldn't be the best pizza in New York, because that's an impossible statement
it's quite close though
The pizza is made the traditional way
the sauce is sweet and delicious - the crust has a hint of burnt taste, which adds to the flavor of the pizza, thanks to the oven they cook it in
Pizza comes out fast and incredibly hot
And although its crowded and packed - the atmosphere is pretty comforting and works
I'll be back fo' sho'
You may have heard of this place as the place to go for pizza in Brooklyn
Nothing can be further from the truth
This place is awful
The atmosphere is poor
The place is packed to the rafters with poor tourists who don't know any better then the guide books they are reading
This place refuses to take credit cards, a dead giveaway of what they think of thie customers
In other words, not much
The wait staff is arrogant and doesn't really care
About the only thing that is allright is the pizza
Yeah, it's OK
certainly nothing special or worth raving about
Off the top of my head I can think of two places with better brick oven thin crust pizza
GOODFELLAS in Bay Ridge and Staten Island and MINETTAS in Long Island City, Queens are far better then this overrated tourist trap
Avoid it
Lived in Brooklyn my whole life
Finally tried Grimaldi's
Do not go ont he weekends it is jammed and you have to wait outside, which is not too nice on a cold night especially since it is right near the water
I did take out and worked out fine
You just go in a one two three tell them your order and you are out the door
I only took 15 minutes for my pizza to be ready
For me it was a little cramped inside but the pizza was so fresh all the ingredients you can tell where fresh
Bottom line- Below average
I have heard the glowing reviews and I wanted to love it
Service was great
Ordered basil, garlic, mushrooms, half olive half onion
Pizza showed up hot and looked great
After the first slice, it got wetter and wetter
It was burned on the bottom so I just ended up with wet, burned crust
What a disappointment
Pauline's Pizza Pie in San Francisco blows away any pizza that I have had in NY, and I have tried them all
Good luck on your quest
And the pizza was $26
Ouch
The best Pizza in New York!!! My mouth waters just thinking about it again
After reading about Grimaldi's I took a 45 minute ride to check out their pizza,it was over priced over cooked and their cheese must have been made of gold because the pizza had very little of it,the next time I want great pizza I'll save some cash save some gas and walk down my block and eat real pizza
This may be the most boring pizza in New York
It seems like they use good ingredients and and cook the pie well
but every combination I try is bland and boring
I live just down the street so believe me when I tell you I have certainly tried to love this place
It's just lousy
Go to Lil' Frankie's in Manhattan instead
After a brief subway Subway ride from Manhattan I arrived at Grimaldi's
I was wet from the heavy rain and mighty hungry
It was about 4:30PM and I was the only person there
Seeing as though I was the only person there, I would of figured it would of taken them far less time to attempt to take my order
I waited nearly 10 minutes before someone came to take my order
I ordered a small Pepperoni Mushroom pizza pie, and a regular Coke
When the pizza arrived it was definitely hot, however the topping was rather soggy from the moisture from the fresh tomatoes
Overall, I thought the pizza was good, but not great
The service was very poor
I can't say I would recommmend it, but at least I can say I tried it
Grimaldi's get's a 9
5 for atmosphere, just below Lombardi's
But seriously guys, all these 10's for the pizza??? I don't get it
Grimaldi's, Lombardi's John's get high reviews because they have cool atmosphere and are in popular locations
But for REAL pizza snobs, go to Patsy's on 117th and 1st or Johnny's in Mt
Vernon, NY
These are hands down the best in the USA, even better than Sally's and Pepe's in New Haven
Even Sac's in Astoria or Arturo's (when it's good) on Houston St
are better than Grimaldi's
Grimaldi's is just BLAND
I don't know who's right in the Grimaldi's/Patsy's family feud, but Patsy's pizza is WAY better
It's not really even close
Take it from native New Yorker; 2 criteria determine a great pie over an average one!! CRISPY CRUST, and tasty, mildly spicy sauce; and a rule in New York style pizza is that the sauce should meld nicely with the cheese
Grimaldi's seems to be one of those nice touristy places for folks from out of town
But if you want the real thing go to an Italian neighborhood!!!!
A little line out front, but definitely worth the wait
Try the garlic and pepperoni pizza
Amazing! Really loved every minute of it! Good place to go with a group
Eat at Grimaldi's now
It's like my old grandpappy said after the Great War, if everyone ate Pizza together, there'd be no war
Well, Grimaldi's pizza is good enough to bring peace to the world
I have walked across the Brooklyn Bridge more than once for a taste of Grimaldi's
As an NYU student it is the best place I know to relieve the stress and hunger of studying
Easily the best pizza I have ever tasted
Been here numerous times and have not been disappointed once
When you want the best brick oven pizza anywhere this is the place to go
I read the high reviews for Lombardi's and John's, and disliked the pizza I got at both places, so Grimaldi's was my last try at finding the perfect pie in NYC
Grimaldi's lived up to its great reputation
This was absolutely THE best pizza pie I've ever had in NYC, if not in the U
S

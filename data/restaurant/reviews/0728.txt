I keep waiting for someone to jump out and say you just got punked!
i have been to 66 a few times for lunch and dinner and have had overall very good experiences
if you are expecting JG 4 star food, this is not it
this is a hip, modern restaurant that pays homage to chinese food and is not trying to reinvent it
the cocktail list is great and you won't find a better wine list for this food anywhere
the service has always been very thorough although i have seen mix ups happen
come here for lunch when it is quieter and cheaper for your best bet
A friend took me here for my birthday recently
We thought it would be upscale Chinese (whatever that means) but we expected some inventive surprises for the food since it is a Jean-Georges kitchen
Instead, what we got was just plain old Chinese food that one can get on any corner in New York City, except prices where quadruple what one would normally pay
The cold sesame noodle dish was pretty good, but everything else we ordered, dumplings with foie gras, lemon chicken, and beef were all really disappointing
The only plus was the service, as is the decor, which is really modern and minimalist
But if one goes to this restaurant to look at the scenery and not for the food, then do not come here, instead, stick to your neighborhood chinese place
The ambiance is actually very nice
Relaxed, airey, not too pretenious
The cocktails are great must have the Wan Chai!!! Wine list is strong and moderatley pricedThe service is ok, nothing special and far from eager, although very hipsterish
The food is the let down considering the chef
They present nicely and the family style food that arrives in particular order is fun (if you know that's the routine here) But none of the flavors pop
Even dishes you think couldn't go wrong go wrong
Like the foie gras shrimp dumpling (over powered by the flavor of citrus rind) or the Short ribs with a depp rich sauce that was devoid of any flavor
It is a nice place to go, but it isn't what it could be, instead it is just
ok
My girlfriend took me to 66 for my birthday last night
By far the most obnoxious dining experience I have ever been unfortunate enough to have
Waited 45 minutes past the time of the reservation without so much as an apology
Waited another 25 minutes to place our order
The food, which managed to come out between 5-10 minutes later, was bland and barely even warm
The waiter, who was missing when we wanted to place our order, hovered over us throughout the meal, as if in a hurry to get us out of there
In short, if you want good Chinese, do some research and head to Chinatown
If you want to be treated as a persona non grata and overpay for very mediocre food, this is your spot
My only complaint: no ambience
66 is as appealing as your high school cafeteria
Sterile, white, and tables jammed right next to each other
BOTH our neighbors struck up conversations with us because they couldn't help overhearing our conversation (which was very subdued)
Meanwhile we were trying to have an intimate romantic evening
Very awkward
66 would be ok for a quick bite on your lunch hour, not an intimate dinner with your sweetheart
The food is mediocre, the service borders on horrendous
We asked the waitress if we could order the Peking Duck off the entree section and use it as an appetizer
She assured us that was possible
We ordered appetizers including the Peking Duck
My husband got his appetizer first, 10 minutes later another came out, while my husband stared at his for those 10 minutes, a few minutes later the third came out, etc etc
When questioned about the piece-meal service, we were told the chef brings out whatever is ready, first
And so continued the service for the rest of the evening
As things were ready, they came out, leaving us diners to stare at our food till we were all served
Of course, the Peking Duck never appeared
It DID however appear on the bill
Maybe the waitress is still waiting for the chef to finish preparing it
seriously
trust me on this one
please do not bother to go there
at least not for the food
contrary to what i had read in the reviews the staff and the service was actually friendly and accomodating
but the food was nothing short of bad
we actually had to send one dish back because it was inedible
i wasn't expecting great food but this was much worse than what i had imagined
the scene was ok, but i give this restaurant another few months at most
We went here last night after hearing all of the hype, and what a waste of money
Every dish was bland and stuff that you would find in a fast-food chinese restaurant
The atmosphere is nice, but not all that - NY has a million better restaurants
I would NEVER come here again
Our waiter was great, but that is no reason to spend $100 per head on a lousy meal
Although this restaurant might be nice to look at, the food certainly is not
The dishes are boring and uninspired
They have the same food that are served at traditional chinese restaurants, only they are more expensive and lack any character
The menu is divided into soups, apps, sides, vegetables, seafood, and meats
There is not one dish on this menu that you cant get anywhere else for less money, and better tasting
The only thing that you can get at this place is the self-satisfaction of knowing you are sitting at a popular restaurant
From the run of the mill dumplings, to the boring main courses, i kept waiting for the meal to get better
Go to mee noodle have a better meal for 10 bucks and then go sit at the lounge and stare at the hostesses
Cause they were the only interesting things at the place
All the 66 bashing should stop
If you want egg rolls and chicken with garlic, this isnt the place for u, sit on your couch and order delivery
The space and the scene is very appealing, and the food for the most part is very well thought out and delicious
The cold noodles are a unique and refreshing take on a classic chinese dish, while the scallion pancakes are so light they could float
Avoid the typical chicken dishes for an entree, and try something new, like the chili prawns, peking duck, or succulent short ribs
Jean!! What is going on?!? Putting your name on this spot is bound to make serious diners second guess the next spot you open!! Did someone without any restaurant experience pay you for your name? Is this a franchise?!?   Food- better in Chinatown at one of several spots
$120 for a couple is highway robbery for what you serve
I left feeling like I had been robbed
Service - being told about the restaurant and the process more than twice is unexcusable as is forgotten orders, etc
Ambience - how do you spell cheap - brand new though looks 5 years (nice bathrooms = highlight)  You really have to watch what you are doing with this one because you have severly offended many of what were once your loyalists
The buzz about 66 has been mostly regarding its scene rather than its cuisine
The minimalist modern decor is very eye-catching as are the hordes of beautiful women who can be found all throughout the restaurant
However, the food surprisingly surpassed my expectations (though modest)
The dim sum dishes were more or less what you find at any traditional chinese restaurant
Of the entrees we had, I would recommend the steamed cod and the sliced steak dish
The peking duck was a bit of a disappointment, as was a lobster noodle dish with very little lobster
Also, as many others have noted, the desserts are not worth saving room for
Altogether, one should expect to come to the restaurant as much for the scene as for the food
If you're strictly looking for great chinese food, your best bet would be Shun Lee Palace or otherwise trekking down to Chinatown
I was excited to try this restaurant, but was disappointed with my experience
The wait staff was decently courteous and attentive, but I was shocked at how bad the food was
Nothing we ordered from the menu was appetizing (shrimp hargow dimsum, corn and crab soup, sirloin, bass, pot stickers), and for the most part was served luke warm
If you are looking for refined Chinese cuisine, I would highly recommend Lozoo over this restaurant
The food at Lozoo is delicious (and authentic) and also offers the calming atmosphere and post modern decor of 66, if that is what you are looking for
Bottom line -- the food was definitely not worth the price nor the decor
I've no idea why my friends love this place so much
The ambience is so cliche- with the music you don't know if you're at a restaurant or the SoHo Grand hotel bar
The food is good, but I've had much better chinese - the champagne cocktails were the best
I'd only go again if my friends insisted on it

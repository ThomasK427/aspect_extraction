The waiter was very good, the guy with the water was always there, the beer was cold, the barbecue salmon was so good
and real value to the money
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! Everyone I take here also loves it and praises it
The waitstaff are great! the food is excellent and the drinks are to die for!!!!! The music is out of site and the people are great! GO here if you are looking for a place to relax after work and have a few drinks to unwind!
The Scene Neither trendy and slick nor haute and haughty, it this cozy wine bar adds a bit of Mediterranean sun to the chilly east 70s
Up front, a small bar and a few window tables make a perfect intimate setting for sipping and snacking; the more serious eating takes place in the not-much-bigger main room
The Food The traditional French appetizers make great bar food, and they're a bargain
Options include an enormous bowl of mussels, an onion and anchovy tart, and a duck liver terrine
A recent special of sweetbreads and balsamic-dressed mesclun, on the other hand, was luscious and deeply satisfying--just what Mom would make if Mom grilled thymus glands
We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night
Service was excellent, and the AC worked very well too (thank God, it was hot!)
Decor is nice and minimalist, food simple yet very well presented and cooked, and the wine list matches the food very well
Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it
Black and blue, that's all I need! Quality of the meat was excellent, I might add
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side
Service was very good and warm
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio)
What a great experience! My friend and I sat at the bar for an hour or so and were thoroughly impressed by the extensive wine list
When we requested a table our bar tab was quickly transferred and the LOVELY hostess sat us at a table of our choice - we chose the corner
Our meal was delightful! I had an arugula, red beet and cranberry salad which was divine
My dinner of sea scallops and saffron risotto was delicious and generous, although admittedly slightly on the salty side
My friend enjoyed her boullibaise which looked hearty and well-portioned
The service was IMPECCABLE, the staff couldn't have been more attentive or kind
Sadly, the restaurant was rather empty until 9pm; we didn't mind, however, as the atmosphere was so quite, intimate, and peaceful
I will DEFINITELY return
and spread the word as well
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty! Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude
Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting
Tiny dessert was $8
00
just plain overpriced for what it is
Three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous
A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service
Great selection of wine, and seafood
Did I mention the wine?
This place blew me away
by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side
The wine list is extensive and impressive
LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris
The mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert
definitely going to be back very soon
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices
Have been several times and it never dissapoints
In Short It's a bakery, takeout place and cafe all in one, and thanks to dishes prepared using the same ingredients stocked at famed gourmet food emporium, Zabar's, prices and quality are upscale
A checkered floor, black tables and mirrors decorate the small dining room, which attracts Upper East Side residents and tourists for sandwiches, salads and the "tower of bagel," as well as for the dinner menu's steak, grilled stuffed salmon and chicken paillard
We ate in the restaurant one day having been satisfied with the deli previously
Wow we really should have stuck to the other side
First I asked the waitress for a Strawberry Lemonade, which I passed on the way in and she said they didn't have any, I was tempted to go to the deli side and get it myself, then my boyfriend ordered a grilled chicken salad, which was just that, literally a small piece of chicken on nothing but lettace for $18
95 unbelievable! Our bill was $80 for a simple lunch that we did not even enjoy
We will NEVER return back, the wait staff was not very pleasant either
Having eatten at hundreds of NYC restaurants I can honestly say this is one of the first I have been extremely dissapointed with
and way over priced!! i think that says it all
oh, and if you're there for drinks at 3:30 on a weekday afternoon, when the place is empty - and ask for a bread basket - they'll charge you $6
even though our drinks came to close to 20$ and the guy next to us ordered a 7$ bowl of soup and got bread included
where's the logic??
Ate breakfast on Sunday
Food was average
Service good
Nothing extraordinary, except the prices
Better off buying from the market side instead of eating in the restaurant
From the time EAT opened it was overpriced
There are many places in the surrounding area that are just as good
if not better
that cost less
Wonderful gourmet salads, sandwiches, deserts
It is a great place to get lunch during a shopping marathon
In Short A worn awning announces the restaurant's own estimation of its food and attracts a largely non-Chinese crowd of families, jurors and couples
The waitstaff briskly plunks down dishes that take alarmingly little time to make, which, in addition to dumplings, include sizzling platters of meat and lo mein noodles
I don't care for the entrees, but the chicken dumpling soup is delicious! It's listed under appetizers, but it's definitely filling enough to have as a meal
This small but tasteful hole in the wall has some really good stuff
I had the chicken dumpling soup which perfect for a cold day
Then I had a hot big dish of Sizzling Beef fried noodle with Black bean sauce
Hit the spot
Came to 11 bucks
Worth every penny
Small and you sit with strangers
Ugly decor
Mint green tiles
But who cares
The food was fine
The place was crowded
Not extraordinarily authentic, although more so than your average take-out joint
Sufficiently mediocre
The food is amazing, and all at an excellent price
I highly recommend the Excellent Dumpling House for all your eating needs in Chinatown
Best Dumplings in the city Try the Chow Mei Fu or the grilled Pork Chop Soup!
An untapped resource
Great food from a hole in the wall
The chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce on rice is perfect for dinner and lunch the next day
Cheap, delicious, and never suffering from the heaviness and greasiness of too many other Chinese restaurants - the food has the good qualities of expensive Chinese for a pittance
The people who gave Excellent Dumpy House ratings of 10 are obviously not Chinese
Only tourists eat here because they're fooled by the name Excellent Dumpling House
Admittedly, the dumplings are pretty decent, but they're not as great as some people would have you believe
My husband and I checked out fish after we read the review about the person who went on a 3 day oyster binge and now its one of our favorite restaurants
The seafood is extremely fresh
We like the raw bar, fried clams, and soups
The fries are oustanding and all the side dishes are really good

I have visited Portugal several times, and look forward to moving there permanently someday
Visiting your bar and restaurant definitely took me back there!! I was also pleased to introduce my friends to my love of Portuguese cuisine and culture, and they are now hooked as well
The atmosphere and decor are reminiscent of places I have visited in Portugal, and every detail is addressed accordingly (even the restrooms!)   Tarcisio was extremely entertaining, and he made some amazing cocktails, especially the martini concocted of Porto Branco
Until my next visit, I'll send all my friends there
Thanks for a wonderful evening, Tarcisio!
I think the people who run Alfama have an incredible secret on their hands
It's been two weeks since I've gone and I'm still vibing off the experience! The staff is amazingly helpful by being patient and helping you select your meal and an accompanying wine
Tarsisio is the man behind the bar who chatted my gal pal and me while making these killer drinks he created himself
After a couple, we were soooo ready to eat! The food is delicious and it's not so much that you feel like you're gorging
Desserts there are a must! I blew my diet and have been adding extra minutes to my cardio because of it
If you want to get taken away to a little piece of Portugal and chat with the people who are serving you without leaving Greenwich Village, Alfama is the place for you
Obrigado
:)
I've been to Alfama a number of times and always thought the food was great
But now, with two newly appointed chefs, Manuel Rocha and Francisco Rosa, the food is simply phenomenal! The best dish is the duck with orange marmalade rice and asparagus tips
I can't get enough of it! The wine list is a true road map to discover Portuguese wines
And on Mondays and Tuesdays they have this great happy hour where you can try different wines at half price
The staff, as always, is friendly and extremely knowledgeable
The ambiance is warm, and has a great vibe
Overall, it's one of the best restaurants in New York City
With a touch of the NY flavor and style, Alfama gives you typical Portuguese food in a wonderful setting
The ambience is so cozy that I always felt at home there (I'm Portuguese)
The blue tiles and the excellent fado singers on Wednesday make Alfama a unique experience in Manhattan
A definite must if you're into international food
The Scene "Babalu" was Desi Arnaz's trademark tune, so it makes sense that it feels like the Tropicana Nightclub in here--pan-Latin-'50s kitsch, bright pink and aqua spotlights and waiters dressed accordingly
Warning: When the live music comes up, you will want to dance
The Food This is assertive, potent Latin food
High-voltage flavors radiate from dishes like shrimp ceviche swimming in a red chili mojo and cornmeal-fried oysters, pumped up with chunks of bacon and enchilado sauce
Truly, everything is exceptional, but the best of the bunch are the most authentically Latin dishes
Picarones are the ultimate dessert: deep-fried, donut-like pastries served with guava whipped cream
this places plays some great music but the crowd was horrible
We went for a friend's B-day and after dinner we planned to spend the night having drinks and dancing
The crowd was not polite and made us feel uncomfortable
We left shortly after we finished our meal
My friend and I went to Babalu on a Saturday because on that night it was free for ladies before 12
Although the club did not open on time and we had to wait out in the cold, the bouncers were nice and friendly, keeping us posted on when we would be allowed to enter
Once we got in the club the music was pumping and we danced all night to hip-hop and Reggae
That party was off the hook!!
I liked the place and the people, but we really went to have dinner no appetizers as the whole dinner
I think they should let you know when you call and make reservations that they changed their menu to only appetizers
I mean they are good but I was more looking forward for a nice dinner
That's all
I took my nephew and his wife to Babalu for a night out, because I had heard a lot about Babalu
Being Cuban, I am not easily pleased with a lot of the so-called Cuban cuisine
but let me tell you
the food was authentic and fabulous
the wait staff was charming and solicitous
and how perfect that the club is right next door (and free if you dine there) with some of the hottest latin music I have heard in the long time
It's not a romantic place to dine and it is somewhat loud, but for pure, unadulterated fun, great dancing and a decent price value
Babalu is da bomb!!
Went to Babalu post-theatre, didn't know whta to expect
While it was large and a bit noisy, the drinks were fantastic, and the food was superb
The prices are not terrible
The service was great, and they have a whole great deal for birthdays
Considering the bleak midtown restaurant situation, Babalu is up there
first we were shocked that on a friday night it was empty
for good reasons
the decor was cheesy and ugly
we started off with steamed mussels that were barely room temperature; i asked for steak med-rare and it came really well done; the fish was bland and tasted more like filet o fish
i wouldn't go back even if it was free!
This past friday, I went to babalu with a couple of friends for dinner
we had a great time there
The food was wonderful
I had the shrimp coconut pupusa which was out of this world and of course a mojito
They had a live band there and salsa lessons
alot of fun!!!!!
I read another review which made me somewhat irrate
Babalu is two different things
A restauranrt and a latin club (which is next door to the restaurant)
You can do both or keep it separate
But if you want to enjoy some of the best nuevo latino cuisine in NYC, go there
Great food!!!  I'm a latin who has taken various gringo groups to Babalu
I've come out looking like the hero
Now, don't attempt the dance club unless you're a real Salsa dancer
I do agree that they could put a little effort in the clubs decor
Great for large parties
In Ricky's name give Babalu a chance!
I just went there for my birthday and let me tell you the food was amazing
The service staff is friendly and funny
If you eat in the restaurant you get in the club for free
It does't get any better than that
I had a blast
The dance floor got kind of crowded at about 1:30am but that was only because my all-time favorite singer Tito Rojas was performing
I had missed the concert but the after party happened to be at Babalu
He even waved at me
I will never forget this birthday thank you Babalu
I kept hearing that that place was the bomb, so I decided to check it out
Other than over price everything , the staff has that nasty attitude as they were making you a favor
The place was way too overcrowded with tiny so called dance-floors,which double as a hallway to the other areas of the club
So you can even stand still for a minute before somebody ask to move out the way, much less try to get yr grooves :b  To make matter worse the music was so freaking LOUD, you can forget about trying to start a conversation with any of the ladies :(  All I liked there was the House Music they played and how crisp it sounded, even when is was loud enough no make yr ears bleed
I really had an awesome time at Babalu
food, decor, service, the live salsa music
all were world-class in my mind
I honestly went there because I've been enjoying Alex Garcia's culinary skills and engaging personality on the Food Network for nearly two years
I was so pleased that the food tasted and smelled as good as it looked on TV
The wait staff was wonderfully courteous and responsive
Everything was so good that I went there two more times during my short visit to NY
the grilled churrasco (skirt steak) with chipotle mash, the Ancho-rubbed pork tenderloin with fufu, the roasted salmon with lobster mash, the Cuban tamal with mushrooms, the Tres Leche dessert
my mouth is watering thinking about it all again
I even got to say hello to Alex and thank him for my great meals

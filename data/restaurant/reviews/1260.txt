You can stop in and have just some cheese and a glass of wine or a full meal
The service is friendly and the quaint atmosphere can not be beat!  There is only one big table so if you go with 5 or more call ahead or be prepared to wait
Wonderful fresh, homemade, out-of-the-ordinary
I had the beat salad and the spinach feta borek, which was just baked
The wine special was a deal at $6
A great place to go for a late lunch or mid-afternoon snack
I chose this spot to meet up w/ a friend and i would have NEVER guessed the candlelit wooden tables in the back of the deli would be so comfortable, so unobtrusive, and so inviting! I loved the atmosphere, the brick walls, and the solid wooden tables, the food was DELICIOUS and fresh, it's not fine dining, but healthy comfort food!!! I will DEF have to return again, i didn't feel rushed to free up the table, and the manager would come and check on us w/o feeling as if he was dining with us
Definitely have to go back - oh
the chocolate fondue w/ the fresh fruit and marshmallows
is to die for
bring your sweetie
Took my sister here before attending a show one evening
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere
We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue
Will have to return to try the chocolate!
The best sushi I have ever had - hands down - great people - Fun place - Looks great
i went last saturday and had a great dinner and the music was great
I was even able to go to the outdoor area and have a smoke and a drink
Alot of fun
this place is awesome! the mood was relaxing
we had the soft shell crab (it came with a sweet chilli sauce), dynamite, and rock shrimp for apppetizers, then we hv the crystal roll and monster roll and a few piece of salmon( the fish was very fresh, feel like it just came out of the sea), for entree we hv the fillet mignon and chicken udon, everything was great and the waiter gave us free desserts
and u hv to try there cocktail, overall we spend least then 100dollar with tips
U HV TO TRY IT !!!!!!!
did the owner write all the reviews himself? the place was fine but the sashimi i got was hard
maybe i went on a bad day but i was really not impressed
Best sushi I've come acrooss in Bensonhurst/BayRidge
Our waiter was great
Recommended a few rolls and appetizers which were delicious just as he said they would be and even offered to take anything we didn't like back, Which was not necessary because everything was delicious
Great variety, great drinks, great service
Will definitly go back
Group of 6 ladies sat down at 7:30 left at 11:00 never asked to leave never rushed!!
With all the choices for Sushi we have these days, it's difficult to really find a favorite spot
However, Let me tell you, this place on 3rd avenue has really good sushi
The place is pretty and the staff is friendly
I definetly recommend Dish to anyone
Make the trip, it's worth it
and better yet, after a great dinner, just down the block is probably the best cupcakes this side of the Mississippi
Oh my gosh! Have you been back to Dish? It was great then and now, even better! They got more leather booths, the drawing on the wall is finally done, and there's now a heated patio with waterfall for private parties or just simply a cigarette break
The new menu looks really classy with quite a few new dishes
Drinks are as delicious as always
Service is phenomenal
Our waitress bought us a round of after drinks too
Sipping on a bottle of the house feature Geysey Peak Sauvignon Blanc and munching on the NEW beef negimaki with live house music in this christmas decorated restaurant is definitely a very memorable night
Dish is definitly the best japanese/ Sushi restaurant in NYC
I love the food and the atmosphere there
The service is great and their is valet parking which is a muct in bklyn
The restaurant is very classy
It is good for singles and couples
Sometimes you just don't want to just eat dinner and leave, it is nice to listen to music and have some drinks while you are eating
I love everything about DISH
It is a five star restaurant !!!!!! The martinis are great, they have wacky names and the sushi rolls are my favorite and the rock shrimp
Everyone needs to go have a dish at Dish!!!!!!!!!!!!
I HAD ABOUT 45 FAMILY FRIENDS AT MY GRADUATION PARTY AT DISH
WE HAD SUCH AN AWESOME TIME!! MY FAMILY KEPT ON RAVING ABOUT THE FOOD THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE PERFECT ATMOSPHERE FOR A GRADUATION PARTY!! MY COUSIN WHO LOVES SUSHI, IS BOOKING A PARTY THERE FOR HIS WIFE'S 30TH SURPRISE PARTY!! GOOD JOB FINALLY A UPSCALE TRENDY PLACE IN BKLYN!!
I was a little dispointed after reading the great reveiws
Sat outside garden/bar
The sushi was average
Nothing special
Had the SeaBass it was very fishy and not fresh
I love the design of this restaurant very clean lines, city feel nice bathrooms
Did not like the idea of unisex brings more of a bar/club feel and older crowd will steer clear
After I ate I noticed a very young crowd
I mean under 23 yrs
, Which in turn, turned me off to not stay at the bar
Considering there was not a large crowd I expected better service
I was planing on giving my server $15
00 dollar tip instead he never brought back change, giving himself and extra $5
00 dollars
Which I thought very unprofessional
THE PLACE WAS GREAT!!!! THE FOOD WAS THE BEST I HAVE HAD IN BROOKLYN!!! THE SUSHI WAS FRESH AND THE FILET MIGNON WAS MADE WITH AN AWESOME SAUCE!!! THERE WAS ALSO A LIVE DJ PLAYING THE HOLE NIGHT!!! I FELT LIKE I WAS IN MIAMI!! I SPOKE TO ONE OF THE OWNERS AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE OUTSIDE PATIO WILL BE OPEN BY JUNE
THE PLACE HAD A MATURE,WELL DRESSED,GOOD LOOKING CROWD OUT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!!! I WILL BE BACK SOON!!!!!
For those of you who are not big sushi lovers, trust me you will love this place
The place is totally trendy
My friends and I went there because we heard so much about it, and we loved it
Not only was the food good, but the service was excellent
My Friends and I were also very impressed, that the owners of the place came over to meet with us
Very nice Italian guys too
IF YOU WANT GREAT FOOD YOU DEFINETLY HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT, THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT, THE SERVICE IS GREAT
THE GUYS ARE HOT IF YOUR SINGLE EVEN IF YOUR NOT
THE SUSHI IS OUTRAGIOUS VERY FRESH
I DEFINETLY WILL BE GOING BACK THERE
THIS PLACE IS HOT ! I GIVE THIS PLACE A MILLION STARS IN MY BOOK
IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW TRENDY HOT SPOT TO EAT, ITS DEFININTLY DISH! THE FOOD IS ABSOLUTLEY DELICIOUS
THE RAW SUSHI IS SO FRESH THE ROLLS ARE AWESOME
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, THE DJ FIREHOUSE ROLL
THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, AND NOT TO MENTION THE ATMOSPHERE, ITS VERY TRENDY AND UPSCALE
SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A NEW, HIP PLACE WHERE THE FOOD IS AWESOME ITS DEFININTLY DISH
My friends and I had dinner at Dish the other night and were presently surprised with the whole experience
The food was delicious, the best I have had in a long time
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful
We even had the pleasure of meeting the two owners of the restaurant
They came over to our table and introduced themselves and asked us how are dining experience was going and if we needed anything
We were pleasantly surprised to find out that the both of them were Italian, how many Italian guys own Japanese restaurants? I would absolutely recommend going to Dish, it was wonderful
Restaurant Dish serve very fusion Japanese food and yet delicious
Well, for me I thinks the main reason to be in Restaurant Dish is not because of the food, Because of it's atmosphere
It's the place to be
Definitely the best sushi I've had in a long time! What a fabulous place the service was excellent
I will definitely recommend Dish to all of my friends I will definitely revisit it myself!!!
Much better than any other imitators of trendy fusion restaurants around the area, a lot more cozier and chiller environment
Pretty good house cocktails, nice to see someone put some thought in that instead of throwing together a bunch of crap

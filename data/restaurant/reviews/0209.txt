We return to this place all the time (10+ of us)
The food is excellent, the atmosphere great
Service could improve, especially when there are several groups at the same time
But we've always had pretty good experiences here
What a lucky find! I was wandering the East Village with a friend and craved authentic Middle Eatern food
Then we spotted Mamlouk
Don't be fooded by it's size and discreet location
This restaurant actually serves really fresh, tasty, piping hot Middle Eastern food
For 30 bucks we were served eight courses
The food just kept on coming! It was delicious! Great atmosphere
Great for dates or small groups
Attractive waitstaff
my only advice is to prolong the desire - don't finish up all the hummus and salads, delicious as they are, because you'll need room for the meat
the pre-set courses keep coming, and only get better
the service is great, the space is lush; besides lozoo on houston, this is my favorite restaurant in nyc
I went here with some friends for my birthday last year
Disappointed by the lack of alcohol, all they had was wine
Food was blah, some was ok and some of it was not
We waited a long time to get served and it was not that crowded
I went to Mamlouk with my boyfriend for my birthday and it lived up to all our expectations
The food was very tasty, and they were very accomodating considering I am a vegatarian
I probably could have done fine with five courses instead of six, because as soon as we got to the fifth, a wonderful vegetable moussaka, I couldn't finish
and forget about dessert
We went all out with a bottle of wine and some Strawberry hooka, but I think this was very reasonable for NYC
Not good for groups especially if the Mamlouk waiters are distracted by their groupies
Avoid the table with the one monstrous speaker blaring the whole night
Service was slow (20 minutes wait time before they came back with our drinks, not including 10 minute wait for them to take our drink order)
Drought is over guys - supply water
For way better and cheaper Arabic food, go to Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn
This place is so good, I almost hesitate to write this review because I am afraid it is going to get too popular and the prices will go up or it will be harder to get a seating! I went there recently with 3 others and enjoyed every aspect of the meal from the tasty starters straight through to the heavenly mango baklava dessert
thank goodness for the hookah break between dinner and dessert
The service was excellent, and they were able to accomodate both the veggies and carnivores in our party
It is a lovely place! Nice decoration, good food - what else do you need? And you get to sample so many different dishes! It is really worth going there and I go again and again!
everything was great
My overall experience was wonderful
love the hooken!
I had a chance to dine at Mamlouk on 8/27 with a group of 7 classmates
My friend, who organized everything (it was her own good-bye party before leaving for France) chose Mamlouk among many other East Village places
The food was diverse ( a bit of everything on your plate), the waiter-friendly and a good dancer :)
The stuff was nice in general, seeing that we were eager to dance, they let us into the downstairs room, nicely decorated and suitable for a big party
We found $30 prefixed a bit too much (we are stdednts after all), however, for an average New Yorker it's a very good rate, considering the quantity of dishes
This is a great, cozy little place, with everything you could ask of a Middle Eastern restaurant
The food just keeps on coming, from dips to salads, to lamb, to fish, to baklava
It's a good thing there are plenty of cushions to lie back on
I was here two times with my fiance and we loved it so much that we rented out the place for our engagement party! It was a great hit! The food is delicious, ther service is warm and the price is unbelievable! This is a must if you want to try Middle Eastern food and smoke a Hookah
We were there on Sat 6/29/02
Seerivce was attentive
The food we got (for a $30 prix fixe) included: crudites, salad, small pitas and that what's-its-name bread with black spices on it, meza plate with about 8 items, two samosa-like triangles, falafel, pasta with lentils fried onions, lemon spinach with beans, lamb kabab, fish, 'mousaka', basmati rice, cheese baklava
The zatar bread was cold and hard, and the lamb kabab was boring
But everything else was excellent to spectacular, better and fresher than we have eaten in fine restaurants in the Middle East
This is partly because of the 2-seating sytem, you wait as they cook each item and bring it to you
By the time we left we were waddling rather than walking
In Short Macelleria inhabits a space that was once a meat warehouse
Dangling meat hooks, carving tables and a giant ghost-white bust of a cow implanted into a wall give the potent impression of a butcher shop
The menu is a smorgasbord of rustic cuisine: dark-toned chestnut ravioli, venison with black-cherry poivrade, a salami platter with prosciutto, speck and finocchiona
Apps were good, but then we waited 50 minutes for our entree
Not a word from a waiter as to why we were waiting, we asked to speak to the manager and none showed up
The filet was not what you would expect from a steakhouse and the other dishes were cold! But the food is not the biggest problem, it is by far the waiters (note that others have complained about waiters in past, obviously nothing was done to train them)
They would walk away mid order, not pay attention to what the customer was saying and were just plain rude
You would think that individuals working for tips would actually be attentive to a big party, but not here
Worst service in NY
and with so many other places to go in the meat packing district it is a wonder this place is still open!
So here's the deal with Macelleria
Yes the steaks are pretty good, and so is the rest of the food even though I didnt try any other entrees, but the apps were good, and they had uber-fresh mozzerella
The problem is as soon as the waiter is handing out menus he yells ok we have the best steaks in the city, its written up
Do me a favor, don't tell me a bold faced lie before I even look at the menu, you're only setting me up for dissappointment
And thats a fact, this is NYC, a restaurant with a 20 zagat rating isn't winning best steaks, end of story
Macelleria, cook ur food and put ur ego away
FYI - the filet is the best cut there
I had the t-bone, filet was much better
I might as well have gotten a menu, went down to kitchen, told the chef what I wanted, got a bottle of wine, pick up my food from the chef, and served myself
Instead, they brought the wrong bottle of wine ( and I should have sent it back, but I'm just not one of those guys) and he annouced how much the bottle was!   When asked about specials: They're on the back
When asked about steak: Best in New York
When asked about pasta: Very good, homemade
Wow
The details are overwhelming
We are from Houston and our son married in NYC in October
We had the rehearsal dinner at Macelleria and it could not have been more perfect
From the planning in March of 2005 to the actual dinner in October 2005 the staff and managment was flawless
Everything was done per our requests even our last minute changes
I would highly reccomend The Macelleria for any occaision and it will always be a stop for us when in NYC
Many of the guests who attended that live in NYC were so impressed and said they would definately add this restaurant to their favorites list
Thank you again Macelleria for the perfect rehearsal dinner
I made reservations well in advance for a special romantic dinner
The hostess had no record of my reservation
When I told the waiter it was my wife and I's anniversary, he actually made fun of us (I guess he thought we were not in earshot
) It was the worst meal I have ever taken my wife to and I regretted it as soon as we walked in the door
Food was nothing special
When I called to complain the next day, I was told that Macelleria was under no obligation to celebrate my anniversary and the rude manager proceeded to then defend her waitstaff
Take my warning and avoid this restaurant at all costs
I have never been so appalled by the service and staff of any restaurant in New York
My girlfriends and I were treated rudely by the hostess, the waitstaff was clueless and made several mistakes, and when I asked to speak to the manager she was gruff and acted as though I owed her money
My friends and I love the meatpacking district and were tempted to try this place because of the steak but we will would never recommend this restaurant to anyone
I get better service from McDonalds

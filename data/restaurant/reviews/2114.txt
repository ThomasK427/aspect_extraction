This place has got to have, hands down, the BEST burger I have ever had in my life! The atmosphere couldn't be better, and the service was outstanding -- at the time there were only two people working the entire bar, and we still got taken care of like it was a five star restaurant
Not to mention that the portions are enormous, but delectable in every way -- and the prices can't be beat
One thing, make sure you have plenty of napkins -- they're pretty greasy (but in this case greasy is good)
This place deserves five stars, all the way!
Whats all the fuss about
Granted, the meal was a bargan by NYC standards but there was nothing special about my burger and the fries were hard and greasy not crispy
Ive had better burgers and fries at the local dinner in my neighborhood: 3 guys dinner on 96th and Madison Avenue
I guess what they say is true
Given enough hype, people will buy almost anything
I waited an hour on line Tuesday night (2/24) for a Corner Bistro hamburger and it was definitely worth it
The wait is ok because you can usually make friends with the folks on line around you
Have a drink while you wait
Yes, the food is greasy and th space is cramped but it is so worth it
McSorley's are $2 and hamburgers are $4
Where else can you get a deal like that? Channel 11 News was actually there the night I was
The place is famous! Try it
at least once
The burger was OK!! Not the best by any means
The place itself is unique, but if you are a germaphobe watch out because at first glance the place looks a little raunchy
I will not be returning for a burger
ever
There are so many other places that have better burger in NYC
The price is cheap, because that's the quality you get
Great place to go to grab a beer and some food with a few friends
Yes it is crowded at times, but usually you can wait around the bar and evenutually get a seat
Its cheap, has good food, and a wonderful jukebox!
The restaurants is small therefore crowded with 1 hour lines on weekends
In addition, the bar is only staffed by one bartender
We had to wait 20 minutes before getting a beer, and we never got our burger order
We even got yelled at for checking on our burger order
We ened up walking out after an hour with no food
Though have been slightly less impressed lately (little less moist than in the past) this is one of the best burgers in nyc
the fries are also top notch, and all at bargain prices!   BEware: the place gets verry busy after 6pm
I have been going to the Corner Bistro for 7 years now and it's still one of my favorite places to go
For those who just want chill and relax with good friends over beers and burgers, this is the place to go
I was looking for an 8-ish rated burger place, and this was PERFECT!! The burgers were delicious, the beers on tap $2/pint (!!!), the music jazzy and the atmosphere dive-y
What it lacks in gourmet -- the menu consists of burgers, cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, and fries -- it more than makes up for in simple and relaxed
The place has a great old-time feel, the servers are friendly, and it's very popular -- there can be a bit of a wait
I went to Corner Bistro on a recommendation
I love the easy going atmosphere and the burger was really tasty
I don't know if it's the best, but it is one of the better places to grab a casual burger
Perfect for a late night craving
People keep telling me that the burger at Corner Bistro is the best in town
It is almost impossible to get rid of that myth
In fact, it is not
I have tried it several times
I met people that haven't even eaten there but still claim it to be the best burger in town
There you have it
It's a myth
Most people are merely disseminating a legend
The only good thing about that burger: It's inexpensive
Best burger I ever had! Very inexpensive and so good! Very nice atmosphere
Seated promptly
this place is one of those places in the city where popularity has gone to its head and it takes advantage of the fact that people actually like its food
waiters and bartenders think they can treat the patrons any way they want to
it is usually crowded, loud and noisy, with people most of the people in the restaurant on a line to get seated
the burgers are admittedly good, but not the best i've ever had
it's good value but isn't worth the aggravation and effort to eat here
I don't think there is a better thing on earth than a $6 burger at any time of day or night
And it's a good burger
a damn good one
I live so close to this place that it literally is my corner bistro
I love it, and I cannot recommend it enough
Having long enjoyed the world's greatest burger at J
G
Melon, 76th and 3rd, I finally (after 15 years) got around to visiting the one place in town that is supposedly better, Corner Bistro
Result: big disappointment
The burger is good and worth experiencing, but it's not QUITE as good as J
G
Melon's
Corner Bistro's burger absolutely does not deserve to beat J
G
Melon's for the top spot
Melon's simply tastes better
Also Corner Bistro's burger is SO thick that it is difficult to eat
Gross
Other than the burger of high quality, Corner Bistro has absolutely nothing to recommend it
The ambiance is really awful, a broken down old place with slanty floors and very uncomfortable seating
Retro? No, just bad
Tiny paper plates, extremely awkward
Really the cheapest paper plates they could find
awful
I am actually surprised disappointed that Dewey/Gayle have bought into this hype
The burgers can be described simply as:Ground Beef Lettuce Tomato Onion Bun Self-inflicted condiments
Anything else tasted during your experience is solely in your mind
There was nothing special about this burger whatsoever
So, this begs the questions:1)Apparently Gayle likes ketchup
Perhaps the flavor of the ketchup is what she tastes that drove her burger appreciation, perhaps this is what motivates Dewey as well
2)None of the aforementioned ingredients were particularly stellar, nor was the bacon or the processed cheese slice they pawned off as cheese
Anyhow, I went, I saw, I ate while I can say it was OK its certainly not a place I would suggest anyone else go
Cozy Soup and Burger is a better burger,but by no means do I believe that that's the best burger in NYC
It can't be and neither can Corner Bistro
If you don't like Corner Bistro then you just don't get it
I have been going there for over 25 years and it is clearly a NYC original
Does it really matter that their hamburger isn't the greatest ever? It's the real crowd, the classic jazz/oldies jukebox, the unchanged decor and cold beer that make it timeless
Perhaps you should turn around and head back towards the Village as I need my seat now
Great Burgers, no pretense
Doesn't get better than that
Dive-y restaurant with a real mix of New Yorkers
I just went here for the first time and thought the burger was so great

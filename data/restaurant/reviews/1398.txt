Greene, Park Slope, Smith Street spots I've tried and have been disappointed with
I've worked in the restaurant business for over a decade, and this is one of the few places in the area that speaks of a real passion for food wine
The eclectic menu well-chosen wine list are pan-mediterranean, and the prices beyond fair for the quality
Sure, not all of the items are fabulous, but most are solidly good, inventive well executed
It's obvious that they worked hard to find good wines from lesser known regions in order to keep the prices reasonable (and they are, for what you get! Restaurants in Manhattan have some of these same wines at $10-15 more a bottle)
I've brought several food-loving friends here they all loved it too
Never been to brunch, but brunch is almost always a harried affair wherever you go, so I wouldn't judge the place by a brunch experience
Not all of the servers are 3 star quality but for Brooklyn they are great, quite knowledgeable, earnest like the place--it makes for a really comfortable atmosphere
I highly recommend this place!
I don't understand why anyone would say the service is bad
maybe they are just really rude or unpleasant people
Everytime I have gone (which is alot), I have had amazing service
The waitresses and waiters are very pleasant and good-looking! Especially the bartender, he is very friendly and cute
The mood is great and the food is excellent
I have taken family from out of town and they loved it to going out with my friends for a glass of wine and tapas
Very romantic setting as well
I would recommend dinner for the best atmosphere, brunch is excellent but sometimes a wait
Olea has something for everyone, true quality
We went to Olea for my Bday
It was a friday night and the host told us that the wait was 20 min
Not bad for a friday, we thought
We sat at the bar and our bartender didn't greet us
We wait around five minutes at the bar and the bartender didn't say a word!!! very annoyed he drop off two menus at us in a very rude way!! We just left, I don't think is worth it to be treated like that
People in restaurants sometimes forget that this is a HOSPITALITY bussines, I can tell, I worked in one
Olea's rather large selection of food, be it entrees or appetizers never fails to please
Freshness is the key word in describing the ingredients
I highly reccomend the lamb and plan on returning
Fantastic! And what an ambiance!
the food was great and i'm looking forward to going there again
we had several tapas and they were all good and at 3-5$/each even better
I had the codfish for dinner and it was Excellent, great combination of flavors and super fresh
good wine list and dessert too
service was not that great but it was packed and understaffed, so that may be it
I was shocked to see the negative comments
Since it's opened up it's become one of my favorite places
The brunches and dinners have always been excellent and the service (particularly the Italian waitress) is very warm, welcoming and prompt
Olea has consistenly delicious brunches
Dinner has been great too, and they have a very decent wine selection
The only caveat is that the service has been bumpy
The first time we went the waitress was clearly unfamiliar with the food and made the rather grave faux pas of calling haloumi a Turkish cheese when in fact is is Cypriot
Most recently, our 4th time back for brunch, there was total chaos - no one hosting or seating or clearing tables, so there was a long line of people out the door, waiting for numerous empty tables
The visibly stressed woman behind the bar was incredibly rude to us
Everything was fine after we were finally seated
However, recommendation to the owner: it's a bad idea to break in a new bus boy during the Sunday brunch rush!
I live in the neighborhood and Im not sure why anyone continues to go to this restaurant
I tried it twice and both times my food was average at best
The french toast I ordered was soggy and I couldn't believe they topped it with fruit that looked a week old
Don't be fooled by the ambience, only go if you're more interested in patios than good food
The ambience at Olea is great (so is the sangria), but the quality of the food on a recent visit was shockingly bad
The bruschetta was topped with a tomato paste that seemed to be straight out of a can
My girlfriend, who worked as a waiter at a good Italian restaurant, said it was the worst she has ever tasted
I had crab ravioli as an entree
It was disgusting
She had fish
It was fairly tasteless
Maybe their Greek or Spanish food is better, but I'll never go back to find out
My husband and I have eaten here many times and have yet to be disappointed
Both dinner and brunch are excellent
Try the falafel encrusted artichoke hearts - yum
This new arrival in Ft Greene feels like an airy country inn in Southern Spain with its stucco white walls, wooden beams, and mosaic tile
The food is truely an ecclectic blend of various Mediterranean cuisines, from Spanish, to Greek, to Moroccan, to Turkish, all of which seem to blend seemlessly and create delicious offerings
I've tried the Imam Sighs, a vegetarian dish, the pork chops with mashed potatoes, the espresso-marinated steak, and the monkfish - all of which are melt-in-your-mouth delicious
I organized a 20-person dinner there for a bday, and everyone loved it
Highly recommend it!
I've never had anything less than a crazy delicious meal at Olea
Whatever specials they have, try one - they're always great
And the calamari/mussels appetizer is AMAZING
Their bathroom is bigger and nicer than at most of my friends' places
The staff are lovely and not snooty at all
The atmosphere is very cozy and relaxing
I can't recommend this place enough
Fantastic food! Chef is amazing and the place is gorgeous
This really is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC right now
The place is filled with character, not to mention the owner who is a character himself
Zucco, the owner and chef (one name only, think Prince or Madonna) is great, friendly, and does everything
He will be your waiter, wine server, busboy, and will seat you
The food was very good and is very reasonably priced
Great date place, although it is tiny
I think max capacity would only be about 12 or 14 with people eating at the bar
I plan to go back, although I do here it can be hard to get a table
We didn't have any trouble and really had a great evening
Let alone this being the best french i have tasted in the city, it rivals with some of my top picks as the best meal i have had in the city
Yes, it is small, but who really cares
One should be used to small environments living in nyc
It is a shame that the previous reviewer did not give it a chance because this is the type of food where you truly savor every bite
Dining at zucco's is quite a food connoisseur's experience! My only advice is do go early so you can get a seat at either the bar or booth
This place tends to get crowded on weekend nights
Well my girlfriend I were all excited about going to this byob restaurant boy were we surprised when we arrived
To say it's small is an understatement
I mean the kitchen is behind the bar he has clusters of small candles, so needless to say the bar area is EXTREMELY hot this was in April when it was a cool 60 degrees
I can only imagine what the summer will be like
But to make matters really bad it's NO LONGER BYOB
He got himself a little liquor license
so we would of had to pay $15 dollars for him to open it which is more than we paid for it
Plus there were no tables
So we left, the menu looked decent but you have to go when you can get one of the 2 or 3 tables
I really enjoy this place it's all the classical french dishes excellently exsecuted at very reasonable prices
That you can bring your own bottle of wine makes it possible to have super good french food with good wine for less than 30 $ in my book that's a bargain
Only drawback is that the restaurant is very VERY small so come early and don't spred the word too much
The food is divine and the owner, Zucco, could not be nicer or more attentive

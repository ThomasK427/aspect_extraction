The wine was served at the percect temperature and complimented the authentic French cuisine
The flourless chococlate cake was the perfect ending to the meal
I could come here once a week just for the pate and crepes
Great French food
The only thing that was lacking was the service, maybe the waiters were all new when I was there this past weekend, but they kept forgetting to bring us important things (napkins, forks, the check) and took a little too long once reminded
But I still recommend a visit
What a reliable neighborhood Mexican restaurant! If you're dining in, the tiny lit room is endearingly cheesy but festive
The freshly made guacamole is fabulous
Portions are big (the sandwiches are super yummy) and the sangria is above average
Recently, my roomies and I began ordering take-out from Taco Taco and were VERY pleased with our delivery
Note: they only take cash!
I had been to TACO TACO before but didnt' get the Tacos
But this past sunday I did
I felt sorta silly ordering the Tacos de Americano, but if you truly crave the taste of the best taco you've had get em
I mean most people have never had a really tasty taco other than (taco bell or a cafeteria)
The taco meat is amazing!!! OH and they will always ask if you would like to start with some fresh table made guacamole
GET IT
the person will come right to your table and you watch him peel avacado and mash it , and squeeze fresh lime juice, with all the other ingredients, its something worth checking out
They got good Sangria and they do an assortment of frozen magaritas (different flavors)
As a 10 year NYer who grew up in Mexico City I was elated to have found Taco Taco
Their food actually taste mexican and not tex-mex, salsa is spicy and they have a great real mexican dishes menu
For dinner I recommend Carne Tampiquea (steak) And for brunch the Huaraches with meat and a couple eggs on top, a typical mexican hangover plate! With a Negra Modelo (hold the lime! mexicans don't drink every beer with lime, only Tecate, not even Corona) I can't imagine getting some drinks there cause the bathroom is down a very steep stairway!!!  And for families they have high chairs and waiters were really nice to my kid
Overall nice experience
Taco Taco is the place to bring a friend or two for margaritas and cheap, fresh mexican
it would be so easy to walk by this hole-in-the-wall, but you'd be missing out on some truly authentic, fresh Mex
It's called Taco Taco for a reason - try them! Also recommend the sopes, empanadas, black bean soup (very filling, watch out) and the tortas (perfect greasy hangover food)
Brunch is fantastic, as well
you're not coming here for atmosphere or great service - just delicious Mex on the cheap!
Having recently moved to NYC from Texas, I am always on the hunt for good tex mex
Although this place looks as if they are in constant celebration of Cinqo de Mayo, the food is surprisingly good and fresh
Unfortunately they do not have chile con queso and their salsa bowls are teeny tiny but overall this is a decent place in the upper east
I've been going here since '95 and it's my favorite Italian in the neighborhood, if not all over town
Great red sauce (way better than my own and approaching my Mom's), really nice owners and staff
Great specials, really good value for the money
Really reasonable wine prices
Let's count at least once a week, 52 wks a year, for almost 9 years
Obviously I LOVE this place and would recommend it to anyone
Favorite dishes - penne arrabiatta (spicy but not just someone throwing red pepper flakes in a marinara - it's got onions, shallots, tons o' nice mellow garlic, and some heat), and chicken parm
Great house salad, nice tomato and mozzarella
also try the mozzarella in carrozo
and good cannoli (i
e
they fill them when you order them)
also try the pumpkin cheesecake
and last but not least, a really good cappucino
Terrific food; freshly prepared
We live nearby and this is a great example of a neighborhood restaurant that consistently provides good food at fair prices
It is not fancy, but they may have some of the best pasta in town
Try the Carbonara!
Simply one of the best kept secrets in New York City
I would highly recommend Table D'hote to anyone for top-rate food, attentive service and a welcoming ambience
I promise you'll want to return week after week


Great french cusine , the soups are amazing
A little overprice and, unfortunatly, the waiter needs some french manners
He gave us a lecture about how raw tuna steak should look white and chunky
All my years living in Manhattan and no other chinese place has beat Chef Ho's
they have the best chicken and broccoli ever!! Now that I've moved away I miss it terribly
They have very prompt delivery service and everything I tried was tasty! I only ate at the restaurant twice, it was a typical atmosphere but the service was very nice and the food was just as good
If you live on the upper-east side this is THE place to get your chinese!
You feel like are escaping the craziness of the city when you walk into this place
It's very cozy and the staff is so attentive
Great food too! Have only been for dinner but hear brunch is excellent
Joanna's is overall a great restaurant with a friendly staff and very tasty food
The restaurant itself is cozy and welcoming
I dined there recently with a group of friends and we will all definitely go back
The food was delicious and we were not kept waiting long for our orders
We were seated in the charming garden in the back which provided a great atmosphere for chatter
I would highly recommend it
Consistently outstanding food and service makes Joanna's a carnegie hill standard
The townhouse atmosphere with available outdoor dining provides ample atmosphere for even the most discerning diner
Personal favorites include the beet salad, free range chicken and one of the outstanding desserts or sorbets
Top service and a knowledgeable staff makes the experience a consistent pleasure
I've been two times in the past few weeks
Always a great time with excellent food and great service
They have delicious specials and a lively atmosphere
Music is adequate for romantic dinners and the staff is always attentive and cordial
I really loved this restaurant
Second time, when me and my wife got there the place was packed and we didn't have a reservation; however, they managed to seat us quickly in this little cozy garden they have in the back of main dining area
Joannas is certainly one of my favorite places in the Upper Eastside! I will recommend it and look forward to my next visit
For the Madison Avenue restaurants in this area and price range, this is one of the better ones
The food is good, the service is very friendly, and the ambience is pleasant
The tables are not too crowded as in the oher two restaurants
The owner of the restaurant is very nice and is usually there supervising things
For the same prices, you get much better food and service
Took my boyfriend here for his birthday on Sunday night and everything was perfect
After 3 years in NYC, haven't found better service anywhere
His lamb was excellent and my salmon was perfectly grilled and the way the dish was presented was aesthetic perfection - the dishes are as great stylistically as they are in taste
They've updated the menu again, with more pastas ($18-22) and chicken entrees ($21-25), and the desserts are fantastic
If you like chocolate than you will love Joanna's desserts! We'll continue to go back again and again
I was there for Valentine's Day
The food was amazing and the staff was extremely personable
Get the swordfish
you won't be disappointed
Shhh! Don't let the word out! Otherwise, you'll be waiting countless hours outside for a table at this very cute, intimate restaurant
I was impressed that this small little nook could prepare gourmet cuisine and offer a vast selection of highly rated wines with very low markup
For dinner I had a very balanced spinach fettucine dish served piping hot with salmon, dill, in a creamy pink sauce
The wine of my choice was a Chateauneuf Du Pape red--highly recommended and very hard to find! Try to get a table upstairs
It resembles a brownstone living room

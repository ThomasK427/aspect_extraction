The food is abysmal and unoriginal
Dinner for two had steaks and white fish
The fish tasted like Mott street in Chinatown and the strip steak was tasteless and butterflied
Who butterflies a $20 steak? The crab cake app was average but couldn't have filled my gold fish's stomach
The broc rabe was ill-prepared and inappropriately served
The only thing Bivio did right was it's vanilla ice cream
With no exaggeration you could find a better meal at a pizza joint in Jersey for a tenth of the price
Beware of being tricked by name, look, location and people who don't know the difference between trendy and quality
Went to bivio tonight, two of us
No smiles or warm welcomes from the hostess, waitress, or busboy
Went early with reservation, place was empty, and they squeezed our two top in between other diners at a banquette
We asked for one of the many available spacious tables, and were turned down
We watched through our $125 meal for two as the other tables we asked to sit in stayed empty, and listened to the conversations next to us, unable to hear eachother
Food is good, not great, nothing inventive (italian, pasta, fish, basic)
The wine list is short and the wine glasses suck (not spigleau or riedel, in addition they are small for the big italian wines on the menu)
Bottom line, the service was below par - no smile or any attention from the waitstaff, but the food is OK
Not going back unless it's free
Given the myriad of bad reviews here and one previous bad dining experience, I was hesitant to take my group to Bivio
However, they're part of Rewards Network (bonus FF miles), so we gave the restaurant a second chance and were thrilled we did
At 7pm on a Friday there were plenty of empty tables and we were promptly seated
Both the waitress and our server were quite pleasant (different from our last visit!) and all four of us RAVED about both our appetizers and entrees
The chocolate sorbet tastes positively sinful
Maybe they've learned that snottiness doesn't keep 'em coming back
Go a little early and you just may have the wonderful experience we did
Lousy food, lousy service-- avoid this place; NYC has much better
The food was uninspired and overpriced, e
g
stringy $8 asparagus and $16 ordinary lasagne that I could have made in a microwave from a Stouffer's box
No effort put into presentation, just a slab of lasagne on a plain white plate
Service was very amateur
The waiter kept pestering us for our order even though we were among the last diners
And then they were sold-out of two of the desserts we wanted
(They took the liberty of substituting other items and still charging full price
) Worst dinner this year--avoid this place!
This place has a great look, but the food is just terrible
For such simple cuisine, Bivio still manages to screw it up
Service is awful, food is awful, and it's overpriced
Sad because it's a really cool space
Would you buy a car because it looked good even if it didnt run well? Bivio has a nice menu
A nice neighborhood feel
But horrific service
When there are ten open tables in a room, the hostess insisted on seating peopl on top of each other
When the waiter was asked to bring the check, he walked off and started to service another table
When I approached the manager, his only response was that Thats how the owner wants his restaurant run  That said
I anxiously await this place running itself into the ground
For any employees of Bivio reading this
I hope you started looking for a new job
you soon will
I used to really love Bivio
It had wonderful pastas and great fish
However, the last time I at there- about a week ago- I have to say the experience was disappointing
The fish was well overcooked- I mean tough- and the ambience was gone
I suppose everyone has discovered Vinto and Spice Market, since aside from two other tables the restaurant was empty
Maybe others figured out what I learned last week, you need to keep the appeal high to tempt customers to come back
Based on the other reviewers here, I was concerned about trying this place out
I arrived with one other person at ~8:30 on a Wed night -- the hostess was very kind and showed me the reservation computer which showed that they were completely booked
She said that the non-res tables might take up to an hour to turn over
She suggested that we try one of the smaller tables near the bar
She brought over stools for us and the bartender was our waiter
Food--amazing
I had the lasagna special and a calamari app
Wine for $25 per bottle
Good service with good attitudes
Not a gorgeous restaurant, but I totally recommend
We've been twice: once right after they opened, and recently
First time we had really good food, and sweet, earnest service
Bent over backwards to make a special dessert
Not crowded
But the host: Obnoxious is too kind a word
here's the rack hang your coats
Way too busy talking to the three models at the bar
Second time, busier but the same story
Too bad, because with the good food, and the good natured waiter, the front of the house will kill them
Had a 9:30 reservation and was kept waiting for an hour without being seated
host lied and had a horrible attitude -- when i asked what was going on -- and explained that we were starving, we were told, well I can't force people to leave
it's one thing to wait for an hour at 6:30
quite another @ 9:30
why even pretend to take reservations?  they didn't offer to do anything for us (a table of six who would have been quite happy to drop a ton of $$) -- after being asked pointedly and repeatedly, they begrudgingly offered us a drink on the house
Too little too late -- there are too many other good restaurants in the area to waste your time on this one!
I'd love to review the food only every party at the door was COMPLETELY IGNORED on the night I paid a visit
There were three parties of two standing in the front entrance looking like bumbling idiots while not a single host, waiter, or manager attended to us
Sure, they looked at all of us, but none bothered to tell anyone how long it would be for a table, take our names down, ask us to wait at the bar, etc
I also noticed a couple of tables looking frustrated since the entire restaurant seemed to have been run by a total of two servers
Funny how many of the positive reviews come from members who've never reviewed other restaurants in this city
I wanted a reservation for 8pm
I could only get 8:45pm
We arrived on time and were told to wait a couple of minutes
I could see their computer screen and saw three different parties walked in and were seated between 8 and 8:30
After 20 minutes I asked the hostess how much longer and she said she had no idea
I saw an empty table and said can we have that one
She said no because that table was for people who had been waiting longer
I asked who and she pointed to my name on the computer screen
I said, That's me
She replied, No it's not
I said, Yes it is
She said, No it's not
I was finally able to convince her and five minutes later we were seated, but our waiter was so busy that we barely saw him
I REALLy wanted to like this place because it's in my neighborhood
The food was quite good but the waiter was terrible
He took our order and never came back

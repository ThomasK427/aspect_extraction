well everything is delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant
This reataurant has it all
Great service and great food
22 different beers and ample wine list and slush type drinks
The ribs are to die for
a must try!
I am so happy to have followed some of my friends recommendations to go to Santa Fe Steakhouse
The steak was truly superb as were all the appetizers
The beer and wine menu is very extensive and definitely they know what they are selling
Thank you Santa Fe for being one of the few affordable and worthwhile restaurants in the neighborhood, you all have really outdone yourselves
All of you out there give it a go, it's a great place to go with friends
This place is really great
They give you these mini pichers filled with soda, and lots of salad and a loaf of bread with each entree
The early dinner special is a great deal, and their double new york cheesecake is really tasty
Waitstaff is very nice and helpful
I've been to Five Burro Cafe a few times and each time it's been crowded
I don't get it
The place doesn't look like much
The food is average and the bartenders are not very friendly
Go figure
I've been coming here for years, and it's always consistent
Super margaritas (as well as other concoctions equally flavorful potent,) great Mexican food, laid back atmosphere, fun decor, and open 365 days a year
Good music and jukebox
You'll be surprised at who stops by
Normally it's a youngish crowd, but last Sunday I saw two elderly women having a cocktail and brunch
All are welcome! It can get pretty rowdy, so I agree with the reviewer who said have a sitter take the tykes for the evening
But if your kid can scarf down a chili relleno, there is sitting in the back away from the bar
A great cantina lives in Forest Hills!
This Place ROCKS!!! I've been coming here for 12 years and I cannot say I have had a better Frozen Margarita anywhere at any price
The place is just too cool, from the rockin' jukebox to the hang as you are attitude within, it cannot be beat
It took me 3 years to try the food (couldn't get away from the bar) and was amazed at how good it was, I thought this place was just a good bar but it is a great resturant
Leave the small kids at home 'cause it's kinda' cramped, but it's gonna' be worth whatever you have to pay the sitter!!!
One of the perks of living in FH
Unpretentious place for great mararitas and good food
Little toys in the drinks are fun too
As a student on a budget, this place rocks! The portions are huge and the price is right
My friends and I always have a good time when we are there and we recommend this place to everyone! The food is Awesome!
THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC
THE DRINKS ARE EVEN BETTER! HOWEVER THE WAITRESS DURING THE DAYTIME IS UNFRIENDLY AND TOO BUSY ON THE PHONE TO WORRY ABOUT YOU
SKIP THIS PLACE FOR LUNCH, BUT MAKE SURE YOU GET THERE FOR DINNER
This is the place to go if you don't want to deal with an attitude, man/women on the prowl and other creepy crawlers
Frozen margaritas pack a punch, food rocks, and there are no jalapenos releno better than those served here
It does get crowded on weekend, the entire weekend, not just evenings and for a reason
Come-as-you-are atmosphere, jukebox, value and James behind the bar work as a magnet
Had a great date at Lucien
Service was friendly, down-to-earth
Although the seating was very tight, the food was great French cuisine with a decent wine list to match
Very charming ambiance
The owners and staff in this place are friendly and attentive
the best place for a pleasant lunch in Queens
I would recommend the blue Margaritas on a warm summer evening
and the Mexican coffee when it gets a bit cooler
The nachos are to die for
the owner could care less about his customers
i understand he treats his staff poorly as well
For Americanized thai it is alright
It is a shame to eat here with so much better Thai food in Queens
In the (relative) area
Bann Thai on Austin St
in FH is better (and more expensive) and still suited to american tastes without being as americanized as this place
For authentic (non americanized) and inexpensive
SRIPRAPHAI in woodside is the place to be! They also have 2 cases filled with thai desserts
BTW, americanized is fine for thsoe who dont really wnat or like the elements of thai food (fish sauce, coconut, chiles, lime leaves
)
The best! Best Food, Best Service
I dont even really like Thai food all that much, but this place makes me love it
Everything is great, speedy, yummy and fresh



and don't want to pay $100 a head
This is a nice, Americanized (nontradional) sushi place, with good sushi rolls and nice portion sizes
Not quite outstanding, but if you get an occasional yearning for nontradional sushi rolls or donkatsu, you can order plenty and not break the bank
After reading all these reviews, I deceided to give it a try
Ok I got the edamame and something from the sushi chef for free, but the quality of food is more important to me than a free small dish (maybe that's why the restaurant gives it to attact new customers
) The sushi/sashimi portion is BIG and GROSS
If you don't care for the quality but rather the quantity, then this place is for you
I'd rather pay a dollar more for fresh fish then to risk getting sick
My advise to anyone that like sushi, check out the sushi counter before you order
I was surprised to find this sushi place
The service was great, the chef even gave me a complimentary dish
The waitstaff was very attentive and I enjoyed my meal even more
I can't wait to go back again
a hidden place in forest hills, that may be hidden for a reason
the tempura was crispy but felt oily in the mouth
sushi portions were bigger than most places and service was average, far better options available in the area
Everything from the food to the service was enjoyable about this place, but I can't recommend the tempura shrimp roll with the lobster salad enough
It was simply amazing and I wish I could get it in Seattle
Tako is a must go
I've been there numerous of times and never been dissappointed
Everyone I brought to Tako Sushi fell in loved with this place
The portion are big, the fish are big, and you must the tempura
It just melt in your mouth
You'll never find anything like it
The house special Tako Knockout is a must as well
Trust me if you're a true sushi lover you'll love this place
Not a local to Forest Hills, so you could miss Tako Sushi because it's down from street level
I had reservations based on the exterior, but the food was very good
I wouldn't go so far as to say the best ever, I've had some pretty damn good sushi in my time, and this doesn't compare
I'd definately go back for more the next time I'm in the area

what can i say i feel home try it people you would love i
I just had brunch with at this restaurant
(3rd time)
First, we waited 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order
During the meal we had to call the waitress over to help us
The most unbelievable part of our meal came at the end when we left
We paid on a credit card but had left a cash tip
Another waitress ran after us halfway down the street holding our bill, and asked if we had poor service
We told her we did but had obviously left a tip, only it was cash on the table
She tried to save herself by telling us that our waitress had been a trainee and thats why we had poor service
We dine out quite frequently and this is by far the worst customer service we have ever received
Needless to say I will never go back and neither should you
The restaurant is nicely appointed, and the service was attentive without being intrusive
The menu is varied enough, but not too extensive
The food was well prepared, and they let us linger over our meal even though the place was crowded and they probably could have used the table
The only thing that could have made the experience better would have been a ban on cell phone use at the tables
The 'phones rang around us all during dinner
Been here a number of times in the last couple of years
It's a nice place
I certainly wouldn't bring a date here
maybe parents
The food is reliably good, if not outstanding
The Tuna Nicoise Salad is the reason I go there
I've been trying to branch out on the menu, and each time I have been pleasantly surprised
Nothing will blow you away here, but it's all consistently above average
Seems geared towards an older crowd, or a family crowd
This is our favorite neighborhood place
They have a great menu and all the food is good
They prices are reasonable too! The cobb salad is among the best in new york and is really big enough to share
There brunch is excelleant too! It gets realyl crowded on Sundays so call ahead and make a reservation! It is a great family restaurant as it is very kid friendly
They also have a patio for outdoor seating which is really nice
In Short Founded in Beverly Hills in 1985, these eateries with the trademark yellow, black and white color scheme have spread nationwide
The decor consists of simple wood and glass with roomy black leather booths
The thin-crust pizzas come with innovative toppings from Asia, Latin America and the Southwest; signature pizzas like the Original BBQ Chicken and Jamaican Jerk Chicken compete with old standbys like pepperoni and traditional cheese
Pastas, salads, soups and sandwiches round out the menu
i came here with 10 other friends to celebrate my birthday
it wasnt crowded even though it was saturday night
ive been to this restaurant a bunch of times before (especially when i lived in boston) and i try to get a different pizza every time
their pizzas are always good fresh, crispy, with very original toppings
i like the thai chicken, peking duck, and the carne asada (steak) pizzas
the optional honey wheat dough is a nice alternative
ive only recently ventured into their pasta part of the menu and have not been disappointed
the kung pao spaghetti is very good al dente pasta loaded with shrimp/chicken in a sweet spicy sauce
the dessert menu consists of all-american classics (apple pie brownie sundaes)
service is a little on the slow side, but i really like the restaurant anyway
The pizza was verybland
It took a very long time for the staff to take my order, to bring my drink, and my pizza
Till Then, I was tortured by all the obnoxious children running around screaming and the parents who refused to control them
I don't understand why parent's allow them to act like that
It's really not cute and its not fair for the other patrons
On many occassions I've been here and this is always the case
If the pizza was out of this world, I'd be willing to tolerate the unbearable children
It's not worth it
I'm going to slap this with a lable that says this place is only for-the-out-of-town-Nebraska-Tourist-with-horrible- kids kind of place
From now on, I will go to Patsy's across the street! This is NOT the place for New Yorkers
I will always have a soft spot for California Pizza Kitchen, aka CPK
They have Great food and pizza toppings that are not in the norm, which always makes for an exciting new find! They go beyond pizza though, they have great salads, pastas, appetizers and desserts
This is a great place for families, dates, big and small groups and the wait is never long and the waiter/ress service is always friendly, helpful (they eat there too!) and timely
It's right behind Dylans Candy Bar and a couple stores down from Serendipity's so if you want more dessert options, they are all around you
I will always love their ginger chicken dumplings (appetizer), and BBQ chicken pizza
Its good food at a good price, so at least go for a try, if you dont like it, you can know for sure that you werent overcharged for anything
I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and every time the waiting felt long
The service was fine but always felt slow
I only come back for the pizzas
The food here is slightly overpriced, but still affordable
Stay away from the more traditional pizzas, as you are paying top dollar for something you could get down the street
I recommend the spring roll appetizer's -- they're better than the pizzas themselves! Their desserts are okay, nothing spectacular
Head down the street to Serendipity 3's for dessert instead
The BBQ Chopped Salad is like no other
Chicken, black beans, yummy ranch dressing
It even has white corn in it
The original chopped isn't bad either
The pizza is pretty good, but sitting there looking at Patsy's across the street is pretty tough to do
I stick with the salads
I agree about the kids, but they seem to stay upstairs, so I stay down
Hey, what do you expect, it's next to Dylans
As for delivery, yes, it can take a long time, and I have gotten cold pizza too
Overall I give it a thumbs up for a chain restaurant though
I ordered delivery which took 1 hour and 45 minutes, cost a fortune (min
$2 extra delivery charge) and the food was cold and smushed
And the beverages intended to be cold were, yes, you guessed it, warm
CPK is worth it if the food is as it's intended
delivery is one sure way to ensure you get a bad deal
I love this place
especially the sinach artichoke dip and the tostada pizza
I'm a vegetarian and I can actually eat here repeatedly and never have to order the same thing over and over again
Too many kids, but totally worth it for the food
As a native New Yorker, I am starved for good customer service
Look no further!!! California Pizza Kitchen has delicious food with AMAZING service
It has a huge menu but get the pizza- with so many choices, you are bound to find the perfect pizza for you
But, don't stop there
The desserts are magnificent! The best part- the wait staff actually have smiles on their faces and seem happy to serve you
Could this really be true? Find out for yourself
I promise you won't be disappointed!!
The Scene There are two distinct personalities to the place: The loud, seemingly always-crowded bar with hanging paper decorations and dim lighting, and the two main dining areas, where the noise level and decor is notably more subdued
Service is swift, competent and helpful, though sometimes less than subtle about certain expectations, like upgrading to a double order of guacamole
The Food Order the guacamole--it's quite good and made tableside with fresh lime, cilantro and jalapeno
Pork taquitos are great, but the shrimp and tuna seviche is hit-or-miss--disappointing when the tuna is a bit past its prime
Among the entrees, choose the stellar mole--deep, thick and chocolatey--blanketing tender chicken or poured over a chicken enchilada rather than the dry arroz con pollo
The chili rellenos, filled with a surprising combo of spinach, raisins and pine nuts, topped with herbed goat cheese, are also outstanding

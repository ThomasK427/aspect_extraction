OK, I personally don't get the Popover thing but when you need to eat with someone who does, what better place to go? The menu is broad and deep enough to satisfy most comfort food tastes
Don't like the long wait -- choose your time carefully
I've been multiple times and never waited more than 15 minutes
Just DON'T GO for Sunday brunch
Period
In Short With big windows all around, a faux-bamboo facade, a tableau depicting space exploration, and a modern, streamlined look, Planet Sushi takes a friendly attitude to Japanese cuisine
In addition to the expected sushi standards, served a la carte or in combos, the sushi bar offers blackened tuna, an eel-avocado roll and other inventions
The kitchen also offers hot entrees, including beef with a mushroom-radish sauce, fluke fillet with wasabi, and scallops in lemon butter
Lunch special is a lot of food
3 rolls, soup and salad for something lik $8
75
Outside seating is nice in good weather and the staff was attentive
Sushi was good but nothing to write home about
The pieces were small but the fish was good quality and there wasn't a lot of rice to mess with
Soup and salad were both good
Would do take-out again for lunch
Check this place out
no big deal
The tuna is a bit gray
Good thing I only order a piece of that
The beef soba is below par
Chewy beef and overcooked soba
The soup base is on the bland side
At a time when many restaurants seem more focused on image than on food, Planet Sushi breaks the trend by offering quality sushi in an unpretentious and spacious environment with an extraordinarily attentive staff
The sushi pieces are perfectly sized (plump and meaty, but not so obnoxiously large that the pieces needs to be broken in two
another inexplicable trend - restaurants have recently confused size with quality)
It is undoubtedly the best sushi restaurant on the UWS and it also can hold its own (quite nicely, in fact) against the premier sushi restaurants in NYC
at about a quarter of the price
If you go to dine at Planet Sushi, expect to eat a delicious meal
Everything is well prepared
The service is wonderful and everyone is friendly and attentive
It is a great place to bring family friends
Both the sushi and the kitchen foods are out of site or should I say out of this world!
Good sushi for the UWS
EXCELLENT service (speed, courtesy, etc
)
Very laid back and comfortable atmosphere
I have previously ordered take out sushi several months ago and it was delicious so I decided to dine in
Both the sushi and the kitchen food were mediocere at best
I would not recommend the hot sauce but the salad was good
There are many better places to get sushi in NYC
Planet Sushi is one of the most serene restaurants I have ever eaten at
You will love the environment and the service
The management of this establishment should get a standing ovation
They seat you promptly and they are always quick to tend to your needs
The sushi here is highly overrated
The pieces are average-sized, and frequently chewy or stringy
Clearly, the quality of the fish is not that great
Decent atmosphere, but when there are other places right down the block, why not go somewhere else?
I've had Planet Sushi delivered a couple of times and I've really enjoyed it
I went on-site for the first time last night and I left disappointed
The service was pretty slow, our food took forever to arrive at our table, we got the wrong order, and it wasn't even that good
It's too bad, because I really like the ambience of the place
I'll still give it another try, though
Great everyday sushi that's surprisingly affordable and high quality
While it's no Tomoe, it has very good quality, spacious seating and sidewalk tables
Usually sushi is so expensive you eat it sparingly, but this changes the equation
Roaming the upperwest side and hungry? Stop here for great sushi, solid service, and if its warm, the outdoor deck offers good people watching
Planet Sushi will never do you wrong
Impatient hungry boyfriend, ran across the street
So we ate here were very happy
Service was good so was the food
Have been twice (not by choice) and both experiences were extremely negative
First exposure was a Friday night party of 5
Hostess immediately interrogated us about our dinner plans/expectations for dining
As soon as we sit down they are already rushing us out the door, telling us there is a minimum of $20 per person to sit
we were already well over and still ordering
Frustrating! 2nd experience was a saturday, party of 2 at about 5-6pm
Hostess was curt and rude again with a hollier than now pre-madonna attitude
Refused to seat us b/c only party of 2
there were 6 empty tables (seating for 24)
The waitress came over took our silverware and menus away and had the hostess storm over and try and escort us to the bar to order
1 Problem
the bar was full! Idiotic service
I loved this place and would go back again
The food was deliciously fresh
The decor was warm and fun
I'm sorry I didn't get the sangria
it looked fabulous
This would be a great restaurant to go to with a group of friends
It's lively, yet romantic
The appetizers are really tapas sized, but the entrees are plentiful
The dessert was huge too
flaming plaintain
yummy
The quesadia was terrific, my lobster salad was delicious, my boyfriends fajitas were sizzling with flavor
My only complaint would be the service, when we first got there the waiter repeatedly asked for our order, he pushed the guacamole (which never appeared even though we ordered it), but then he disappeared and we kept having to ask the busboys for help
The waiter seemed very overwhelmed and scattered
Even so, it was a very good evening and I'd go back to Cafe Frida again and again
They brought my mother a chicken enchiladas instead of cheese and then it took her 10 minutes to explain what the error was to the waiter and bus boy who then finally had to tell the manager who was also confused and my mother is fluent in Spanish
When they finally came they weren't very good she could've gotten better ones at a hole in the wall Mexican place for a third of the price
My entree also fell short grilled King Prawns- they were either not very fresh or over cooked
The corn souffle I had on the side was really good as well as the chips and guacamole we had as an appetizer
I had a pommegranate Margarita which was delicious
The decor of the place is really great I would go back for the drinks, and guacamole with some friends or on a date
We stumbled upon this place and we're so happy we did! They accomodated us - a group of 9, plus a toddler and a baby asleep in a stroller - in a prompt and friendly manner
The food was great even though it was a little on the pricy side
Definitely recommend the sangria!
The greatest mexican restaurant in New York City with all the flavors you test when visiting Mexico and the service from the moment you step in this colorful restaurant you are greeted by a hostess with a beutiful smile
We we were greeted by a rude hostess, but I was still willing to give Cafe Frida a chance

The Scene This meze house--the Turkish version of a tapas bar--attracts families, as well as older couples and groups
Since the place gets crowded, the usually attentive waitstaff can sometimes become harried and profusely apologetic
Somehow, though, the bread basket is never empty
The Food The meze span a range from familiar to exotic
The creamy hummus is a good use for the crusty bread
A sharp take on tabbouleh is also excellent, and feta rolled in phyllo dough is a crispy standout
Eggplant sauteed with tomatoes and garlic is a good choice, but the mashed eggplant is too mild and slithery and the tarama salad is salty
Garlic pervades savory salami, balanced with a dose of cumin
Larger dishes, like doner kebab slathered in yogurt sauce, are fine, but not the main attraction
Halvah spiked with pistachios is a must for dessert
Don't be put off by Turkish
It's really Mediterranean/Greek/Italian
Yes, there's hummus, but also spinach with garlic and yoghurt, shrimp and a nice white wine list
The service was upbeat and friendly, even when one of us boke a wine glass
this is restaurant is pretty nice and the food is very good so it is surprising that it is SO CHEAP
the service is really pretty terrible, but friendly and apologetic for being terrible, so if youre not in a rush it's no big deal
the bread is amazing and so are the fried cheese appetizers
good kebabs and dinner salads
pretty bumping for a tuesday - should probably make a reservation
really cute outdoor seating
i had a couple glasses of wine, an appetizer, and an entree for like $26 including tax/tip
cant beat that in NYC, especially if youre looking for a place without disposable flatware
When I was living in NYC, I would generally have dinner here at least 2 weekends a month
The price, service, atmosphere and mostly food/taste is GREAT
Highly recommend it to anyone who likes Turkish
Years ago, I spent 6 months Istanbul
Pano, in Beyoglu, was my favorite place
I USED to love Beyoglu because, although not as good as Pano, you could have a similar experience
My most recent visit was a nightmare
Three of us ordered a bottle of wine and a mix of appetizers, salads and entrees
I ordered more than 8 items, to start
I asked the waiter to bring everything in whatever order was easiest, but only 3 dishes at a time
He told me, and the manager confirmed, that restaurant policy allowed only TWO trips from the kitchen
We had to have all of our food in two courses, regardless of how much we ordered
That would be absurd at a diner
At a Turkish restaurant it is insulting and unforgivable
In Turkey, you don't even order your courses all at once
We walked out
I have been here many times, sometimes with adults only and sometimes with kids
We almost never order entrees
The service can be distant at times - and I suspect this is because they are disappointed that we aren't ordering more - but I have never experienced rudeness of the type I see described here, and in many cases they have been very friendly
We love the spinch/yogurt, hummus, eggplant salad, kofte, and the desserts - halvah and baklava
We think the bread is delicious and always have to ask for more
Everyone from kids to our aging parents who are new to Turkish food has loved it
It can be crowded, so make a reservation, but overall I would recommend this place
It is also a great value if you stick to appetizers and desserts
I've been to Beyoglu many times
The first few it was completely amazing - great food, service, you name it
Then things started taking a turn for the worse
THe food was cold when it should be hot, hot when it should be cold - the Babaganoush tasted like garbage, and the other mezzes were just *ehh*
I went back recently with a friend - it was supercrowded so I thought things must've gotten better
All that wait for nothing! My service was terrible - not just slow (it was), but RUDE
Eye-rolling, food-rushing rude
I can tell you for certain, it's them, not me
The food was above average only, a bit too much garlic
Also, one problem is they charge for olive oil
But, the service is friendly and helpful in a way that is beyone words
I was in a horrible mood upon entering the restaurant and unfortunately I took it out on the waitress
She never failed to smile and treat me with complete respect
By the end of the meal I was in a great mood and she got a wonderful tip
I would return again just for the service
Yummy! I don't know why this restaurant received such negative reviews
This place is great!! The food was absolutely impeccable!!! It was a highly sensuous meal with an orchestra of flavors and colors
The beautifully presented vegetarian platter served as our meze and the doner kebabs kept our taste buds yearning for more
When you step foot into the lavish restaurant you feel as if you should be paying more
But this place is an absolute steal!
Great food, solid atmosphere and a little something different on the upper east side
Go there with friends and enjoy a little cultcha
I had heard many good things about Beyoglu but I was very dissapponted with both the food and service
The meze was ordinary and the donor kebab was cold
In addition our non Turkish speaking waitress was inept and in short an idiot
Being a Turk, I know what good Turkish food is so don't waste your time and money at Beyoglu
For a truly great dining experience in terms of food and service go to the Turkish Kitchen on third avenue
We really enjoyed the ambience of this venue
The first time we went the waiter was great, the second time not so great
The food is always incredible, I like to think of it as turkish tapas
The eggplant is wonderful
We order lots of appetizers and then one or two main meals for the four of us to split
This works well because you get to try lots of different dishes
I would go once a week if I could
It's great!
I live in the neighborhood
The place seems crowded a lot so we tried it tonight
The food was bland, bland, bland
The chicken for the special was average deli meat
The swordfish resembled the chicken (literally)
The bread was like pizza crust without the pizza to recommend it
The waiter should ask for his laundrymat job back
IF MIDDLE-EASTERN /TURKISH/GREEK DISHES APPEAL TO YOU
GO DIRECTLY TO BEYOGLU EXPECT GREAT HUMMUS, EXTREMELY SMOKEY EGGPLANT SPREAD(BABAGHANOUH)
THE OCTOPUS SALAD IS A WINNER ASWELL
ORDER THE VEGETARIAN ENTREE AS GOOD SAMPLER FOR TWO
I COULD GO ON ON SINCE THE APPETIZER MENU WASENTICING LONG
WE FOUND THE SERVICE VERY POLITE ACCEPTABLE FOR A BUSY SUNDAY PM
PRICES ARE EXTREMELY FAIR
ALLOWING ONE TO ORDER FREELY WITHOUT RISK OF A STEEP TAB
WE HAD DINNER THE NITE BEFORE AT MILOS
THE CUISINE WAS NOT THAT DISSIMILAR
BUT PLEASURE/COST RATIO MADE BEYOGLU A CLEAR WINNER

Great wine, great salad, EXCELLENT thin crust pizza and AMAZING gelato --try the hazelnut
The place is huge -- there was no wait for a table
It is a very hip pizza place
I realized Otto was a wine bar and NOT a restaurant
Im not a wine connoisseur so their extensive list didnt impress me
The atmosphere is very nice and inviting
I was lucky enough to be seated in the elementary school section, tables right next to each other
Theyre nice enough to give you one piece of bread but dont expect any olive oil or even butter
The table next to us was lucky enough to get some olive oil on the house
What a joke
The menu was completely confusing
It was like reading a Chinese menu with no translations
Seemed everything was strange and bizarre just to be annoying
The portions of the antipasti were pathetic
The pizza was bland and tasteless
It just wasnt good
And to top it off, they didnt include a lemon peel with my espresso!
i agree with some of the other reviewers
otto isn't so much a full restaurant like mario's lupa or babbo but a fantastic italian wine experience
go with friends who appreciate great wines, order a couple of pizzas or antipasto to munch on and hang out, talk, and laugh
the restaurant is cozy and comfortable
don't forget the gelati, it's delicious, creamy, and flavorful
as usual mario's wait staff are well educated and very helpful
Though the pizzas were good and had delicious fresh tomato sacue, lets face it, its still pizza and it doesn't become any more amazing after an hour and a half wait
The wait staff and sommelier were knowledgeable and helpful, but I would only go back during the off hours or when the hype dies down
It would be a good place for an interesting glass of wine and a snack when its not so crowded
the pizza romana was delicious as well as the caprese
But you absolutely MUST try the Olive oil gelato with Blood oranges! YUMMY!!! It had to have been a recipe discovered by accident ! the service was great, but the atmosphere was more like TGIFs or Houlihans
no real character
Hearing the name like Mario Batali's associated with a restaurant makes any wallet cringe
My lady and I were in the mood for something different, so we tried it out
I, who hates anchovies, was stunned by the Romana pizza
It was really good, along with great crisp wines
They were overpriced, but I couldn't help but beg for more! Although the menus were like reading a foreign map, our server explained everything to ensure an pleasurable experience
Gelato is a must! I can't stop supporting mom pop shops, but this is a great change of pace
I shall return; believe that
Went for lunch on Sunday
The place was very crowded and not quite as nice as Clementine's was
Sampled a few pizzas, some wine, and a salad
The pizzas were pretty good
I'm just not sure what all the hubbub isabout
Arrived, received one of their silly tickets (Biglietto/Emilia)
Did not feel transported to Italy
Ordered the lardo pizza, the pizza came with a strip of bacon on top?Did they think that someone who ordered lardo, wouldn't know what lardo was? The salamis were also uninspired
The best dish was the fritto of the day, a chickpea concoction that was delicate and delicious
The chocolate gelato was excelent and my wife had a strange and complex dessert that while improbable in prose, was delicious in the spoon
The room was full and festive; but then most NYer's dine for the experience, and not necessarily culinary
All this place has his the name of Mario Batali, my wife and I went there and were very disappointed
It was so so at best and definitely not worth the prices on the menu! There are much better pizza joints all over the city!! total bust
Bar: great bar areas, very impressive wine list with very knowledgeable staff to help in the selection, this part is a home run
Restaurant: way too noisy, can't hear yourself think, food selection extremely limited, staffing may be insufficient to provide attentive service, pizza kinda weak, been to italy enough times to really know what it's like, I'd rather have the black olives on my Quattro Stagione than swiss chard thankyouverymuch
While I can understand the low priced menu given the university surroundings, if this place is going to succeed I think they need to rethink the menu
First the compliments: I actually liked the ambience
Nothing fancy - looks quite similar to the previous restaurant/bar/club that it replaced
But the setting is casual, lively, and perhaps a good place to meet others as everyone is encouraged to wait (no reservations) at a relatively large bar area serving up a very comprehensive list of Italian wines
Now the rest: I think the editorial review said it all
the pizza is really not good
Really! And that is a shame as the restaurant is a pizzeria with a very limited menu outside of pizza
Expensive, for unremarkable pizza
The clam pizza is served with the clams in their shells
I think at $14 for a very small, mediocre pizza, they should take the clams out of the shell
The other pies we also tried, were not great either-bland and tastless
The salad we ordered was not fresh, it was brown around the edges, the whole thing should have been 86'd
We waited a long time to get our dinner
Normally, I don't mind, but when it is pizza, you expect to get it a bit faster (especially with a 2 year old with you)
I am surprised this is a Batali enterprise
He needs to do A LOT of fine tuning on this one
Definitely, worth skipping this restaurant
We went to Otto on a Saturday night around 9:30
It was packed and we ended up finding a spot on one of the many white marble counters in the front of the restuarant
There was no seating room but we ordered an appetizer (eggplant) and the selection of three cheeses, and some drinks
The cheeses came with pairings such as stewed cherries, chutney, and citrus rind
It was a nice experience-especially with the wine paring
The pizza, however, was not as great as I thought it would but then again, we didn't try the more inventive pizzas
Dessert-I had to try the ricotta gelato
Very good
We also believed that the atmosphere in the front of the restaurant was more of an experience to behold than sitting at the tables
Just a reminder, you can't order pizza if you don't sit at the tables
Enoteca? No
Pizzeria? No
Mario out for the buck? Yes
THE most confusing menu every written
An incredibly over priced wine list
Ear busting noise
Group style seating, like your elementary school cafeteria if you do not exactly fit one of their open tables
The pizza tasted like matzoh bread with sauce on it
I liked the atmosphere, but our waiter had such attitude
They have a great wine list, and the gelato was really good
However, this is NY - better pizza can be found just about anywhere
I expected better from Mario
Mario, Mario
I was very hopeful to find true Italian pizza
With all your travels to Italy (even working in Bologna, my hometown) I expected Italian pizza
It's simple really
But, while your pizza still has American flair for too much tomato sauce and overuse of cheese (and not made in a wood burning brick over - although that is another issue), I have to admit you very much succeeded with your vegetable starters and salads! I was so happy to have some pesciolini! and your tricolore salad was wonderful, finally!!! And, my goodness, I was even able to have an aperitive AND a digestivo, thanks to your wonderful sommelier
So while I will probably not have pizza upon my return (and there will be another visit) I will indulge in everything else which you do so well
Just because the menu looks cheap at first glance doesn't mean you'll spend less than 40 dollars at this overrated pizzaria
Why? First, you'll be waiting at least 1 to 2 hours on a busy weekend
That means you'll be buying drinks and probably appetizers
By that time you'll be so hammered you'll probably order the 4 dollar Olive app

If you are friendly with the serving staff, most likely, in traditional Italian flare, they will offer you a complimentary digestive (after dinner cocktail)
Great and original salads, pastas and meats, and great ambience, especially late on a Sunday night
This is another example of an Italian restaurant not run by Italians
They use the Italian brand to sell food
It's anything but traditional Italian food
When I went there I asked the waieter if their past with mushroom was made with porcini mushroom, he said yes, I got my pasta dish and it was made with canned mushroom, you know the ones you find on a slice of pizza
Clueless is the word
My wife and I have been to this place in our neighborhood twice and plan to go back
The atmosphere is comfortable and the service is nice
An all around great neighborhood restaurant
If you go, you must get the Momma Lorna dish
Pretty simple, farafelle pasta with sweet sausage in a cream sauce, but it is delicious and the only thing I get when I go there!
Conveniently located right next door to the best movie theatre in Manhattan
Tie-on some big beers or wine with your Chicago-style deep-dish pizza
Try the Chicago classic style with gorgeous sausage and lump tomato on top
We added black olives for delicious pizza
Order less than you need bc the pizza is filling
The big pool hall is also nearby
The waiters and waitresses were fast and friendly, the food was served promptly and the atmoshphere was vedry plesant
Also the price range is ver reasonable
I go about once a week
The only bad thing may be the elevator music at times, but overall a good experience if your just hanging with some friends or if you want a nice night out with a special someone
Setting foot into Rohr's for the first time was quite an experience
The music is pleasant
The atmosphere is homey
The people are prompt and polite
The coffee is of highest quality and with so much variety it becomes fun picking out a flavor every morning
You can make friends quickly; serendipitous enough I found love at that very shop
Thank you M Rohr's
Wow! I was blown away by Rohrs' variety of coffee! They have at least 50 different flavors and all of them are roasted with the flavor, not sprayed with syrups
On top of it this little mom and pop shop has such a warm and friendly atmosphere you would be shocked to find it in the heart of ny city and the upper east side no less
Definetely stop by you wont regret anything you get there
and try the Rugelach
delicious!!!! I think they have a website
so check it out is you can't visit
you'll thank me later
trust me!!!
A great find
This neighborhood has a coffeehouse for everyone
Starbucks is here for those who are in their own little private Idaho but at M
Rohrs the characters abound! This place certainly has personality
The coffee is wonderful and the aroma will make you melt
Coffee quality is on par with Peets
The flavored coffees are my favorites because unlike other places the flavors are added during the roasting process this creates a better brew and a taste much better than syrup in coffee--yuk! Oh, and they have loads of loose and imported teas [ PG Tips :) ]
If you're in the neighborhood GO, you won't be disappointed
A classic on the UES (although it hasn't always been on 85th Street), the store provides an awesome variety of coffees from around the world - my faves are still the columbian and french roast! Ambiance galore! And if you're lucky enough, you can catch a seat in front of the store on a saturday morning or afternoon and just people watch!
I heard about this place from a friend, and she wasn't lying when she said its the best meat you will ever taste
The selection is huge- from Bison steaks to baby lamb chops, its all delicous! Not only that, they also have a whole cooked foods sections, for those nights when I dont have time to cook
I love this place!!
Burst of flavor in your mouth
Wineturtle grew up on this stuff the Poulos Family has a lock onPapaya imports and it shows Freshest best tasting Papaya Drink
but the Orange drink with two dogs
thats it no question
Nathans is Nathans But Papaya King is just the best After a night of sip sip sip
The nicely spiced Dog with Coconut Drink puts you right again
John Lindsey(former mayor of NYC) was a big fan I'd see him with his wife a lot thats how long they have been NUMBER ONE!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely the best hot dog in the city, perhaps the country
No comparison to the cheap Papaya knockoffs
These other joints may sell cheaper dogs, but the orininal Papaya King @ 86 Str
3 ed
Ave
is still the best
Also Papaya King's drinks fresh fruit shakes juices are way superior to to the others
Papaya King is WAY better than Gray's Papaya
Gray's Papaya only offered me a choice of two toppings and NO relish
What kind of hot dog doesn't serve relish? No, Papaya King is truly the tastiest frankfurter around
There's no question, go to the west side, Gray's Papaya is much better than Papaya King
The hot dogs at Gray's are much tastier, but both are good
And the people in Gray's are nicer too
GREAT GREAT bagels - one of the best in nyc - always hot - not matter WHAT time of day - so good!
These are supposed to be the best bagels in New York? I'm sorry, but I've been here several times -and- these bagels are only AVERAGE
There aren't bad but they aren't Great either
They are the same size and taste that you can get almost any other place in town
If you did a blind taste test with me, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between these and any other brand x bagel
I just don't get the hype
I would say: If you are in the area and want breakfast - go here
However, do not make a special trip
These bagels aren't worth the carbs or a trip out of the way
DD has bagels just as good
That my opinion
The Scene This Upper East Side joint belongs by the beach with its order-at-the-window vibe and cartoon french fry signs
Half of the room is devoted to the order line--it's primarily a to-go business, and seating is limited to a wavy blue countertop dotted by a few diner-red swivel stools
Though the counters could use a wipe-down, order-takers are cheery enough, singing along to the cheesy remake soundtrack
The Food The burgers ride a fine line between fast food and slightly better than
Shrunken to about four bites, the sliders arrive as skinny (almost skimpy) patties, tucked into squishy potato buns
The beef borders on mass-produced re-hash, while the turkey is especially flavorful and the veggie packs a nose-clearing spicy honey mustard
Want more meat? The pulled barbecue chicken's piled much higher
Money-saving combinations include nostalgic boardwalk-style fries--served skin-on and perfectly salted--and upgrades like soft-serve milk shakes
As suggested in a previous review for this place, it is indeed a White Castle Wannbe
I stumbled in because of the newspaper clippings taped to the window declaring it a little burger with a lot of flavor
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing
It certainly beats your common fast food chain, but not by much
The burgers are small, and boring, but the fries are good
To make a long story short, White Castle has better food and better value
Unfortunately, there's not a White Castle in the area
The veggie sliders are surprisingly good, as are the fries
Stay away from the cajun or garlic fries - they're just regular fries with spices sprinkled on them

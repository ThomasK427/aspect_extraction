What's funny about the last posting is that munch doesnt even serve burritos! For someone who has so much to say, he didn't even get the food right
Anyway, they're packed on the weekends and rightfully so
Their teas are really good
I think they're fresh leaves

I went to Munch because of the high rating (9
5) and three favorable reviews
I will not trust a Citysearch rating unless there are at least 20 reviews
I would give Munch a way below average rating
First, the food was below average
Second, the sandwiches were overpriced given their contents (the chicken burrito was 90% rice)
Third, the service was slow
The hot tea was good
I went to Munch solely because of its high Citysearch rating
I was extremely disappointed
I hope the owner will laern from this review
The place has a good atmosphere, but they have to improve the quality of the food
Munch has been a wonderful addition to my list of favorites
This place brings a feeling of family back to the neighborhood and always provides a place to relax with good food and good music
The menu is very diverse and has tastes for every palette
The service is quick and there are always friendly happy people behind the counter
It is a great escape for the hectic-ness of Austin St
and at a fraction of a cost
Dont forget to bring your appetites!!
Munch Cafe Grill offers a wide variety of tasty, healthy gourmet wraps/paninis/entrees at more than reasonable prices
Not only does this cafe have a great assortment of coffee, it (to my surprise) caters to tea lovers like myself
There are so many different kinds/flavors that I often have a hard time making up my mind!  Quick service and friendly, helpful staff will make you come back time and time again
Great place to bring a casual dinner date, grab a quick bite to eat (to stay or go), or even kick back and relax in the lounge area with a cup of coffee and a good book, magazine etc
Need to check your e-mail? You can do that at Munch Cafe Grill as well
(I think 15 minutes for $1
00)  All in all, great atmosphere
Very comfortable and inviting
Definitely my preferred choice for casual dining
Not only was the food really good but the service is excellent
Definitely recommend this place
Nice, friendly feel too
They even had a band perform that weekend
Good place to check out for brunch
Even though it was so close to Austin St
, there wasn't the hassle of parking and traffic
Save yourself from this awful place! I went to this restaurant for a going away party for a dear friend of mine
We were a party of five
The waitress literally bullied us into ordering immediately
When we were halfway through the meal, they began clearing plates without asking us when the plates still had food on them
We were in shock
I asked to see the manager and explained to him that this was poor form and that we were not finished
Hovering over me, he explained that this was his restaurant, that other people were waiting, and we needed to get out now
We quickly paid, of course leaving no tip
The waitress saw this and began berating us in front of the other customers
My wife went to the front cashier to ask for the manager's name
The manager saw this and came running over and physically intimidated her
I stepped in and asked him to back away
He and two waiters then literally pushed me out the front door cursing me! I'm still deciding whether to bring criminal charges for assault
For the love of God, please don't support this awful business
There are so many other good Korean restaurants in this neighborhood
I am in a state of disbelief over this incredibly negative experience
My Sisters Gourmet Deli is the best deli
The food is incredible
The owners are extremely nice
The only problem is the only seating that they have is one table and a counter area by the window
I will continue to go there but can't have friends meet me there because there is no guarentee that we would be able to sit
Great for grabbing lunch on the run
I love this place
The ambience is great (romantic and low key)
Its a great place to go for a cup of coffee, a small bite to eat, or a glass of wine
The food menu consists of toasted bread w/ gourmet vegetable and meat pates ($3), salads, and desserts (including sorbet served in a real fruit)
In Short Boomerangs, Aussie flags, kangaroo portraits and faux aboriginal art honor the homeland's wilderness, but Outback delivers a polished version of rusticity with varnished blond-wood booths with matching wainscoting and casually uniformed waitstaff
Besides more than a half-dozen cuts of steak, diners can pick from large-portioned entrees like ribs, chops and shrimp or chicken "on the barbie
" The Bloomin' Onion, a large onion dipped in batter and deep-fried, is an appetizer with a following
While I normally wouldn't choose a chain restaurant in a city full of fabulous fare, this is a great option when you want a tasty filet, a nice glass of wine and can't find a babysitter ;) They don't take reservations per se, but if you Call Ahead, they will put you on a list to reduce any wait time by half when you arrive
I really enjoyed the Outback steakhouse
If your in the mood for some low-key food, this is the place to go
The food is always reliable, I highly doubt you will have a bad experience
The whole enviornment is very relaxing, great for going out with good pals
The prices are a little high for a chain but its NYC, what are you going to do?
Obviously, you shouldn't be hitting chain restaurants in a place like New York City
But if you absolutely have to, please skip Outback Steakhouse
First, the restaurant was about 54 degrees
Second, the prices are ludicrous
$4 for a cup of soup? $13 for the shrimp caesar salad which consists of five count'em five pieces of shrimp, atop two pounds of iceberg lettuce and a light dusting of romano? Good lord
What a rip
Next time I'm in the mood to throw away my money at a chain, I'll just go to McDonalds
I accidentally stumbled on an article that mentioned an old favorite haunt, called Orson's in the LES that mysteriously disappeared
It mentioned that owner/chef Shaun Rosenberg had since opened Parish and Co
We dined there last night and were not disappointed
The food was as fresh and inventive as I recalled, yet not pretentious
evewe ordered quite a number of the small plates because the selection was so varied and evrything was delicious
It occupies a great space and is tasefully decorated
The service was friendly, and we even met the owner who came by to chat
The clientele looks like a neighborhood crowd, which makes me wish I lived in the neighborhod
Parish is a pitch perfect upscale casual neighborhood restaurant; it's very comfortable, low key but very tasteful decor; the staff is friendly and service spot on; the food is always very good and fairly priced; and the wine selection is well-chosen with great bottles at all price ranges
Many menu items are offered in two sizes: a smaller, tapas-style serving and entree-sized
Every neighborhood should so lucky to have a place like this
Parish is a gem
The brunch on the weekends is completely enjoyable and the ambiance is laid back and comfortable
Late night is always active and the chefs' dishes are really amazing
I have never been disapointed in Parish and Co
and would suggest it for any event large or small
The food is really good and organic, probably the bestt you can get for that price
The atmosphere is cozy, with great music, and unpretentious
